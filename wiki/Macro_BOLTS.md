## Description

The aim of BOLTS is to build a free and open-source standard parts library for CAD applications. It does so by providing a common database that can be utilized by many different CAD applications, and leveraging the parametric power of FreeCAD to create many different variatiants and sizes of a part.

BOLTS for FreeCAD provides a widget that allows to insert parts into the active document. Sizes and variants of a part can be selected in the widget, and the part is given a descriptive label.
