# BIM Trash

## Description

The **BIM Trash** tool moves the selected objects to the \"Trash\" group. The Trash group will be created if not already present in the document. The Trash group is simply a hidden group, that allows you to not permanently delete objects, but still retain them in the document. This is useful when you are unsure if you\'ll need objects later, or if an object cannot be deleted because other objects depend on it.
