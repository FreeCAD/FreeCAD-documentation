# Design456 Extrude

## Description

The <img alt="" src=images/Design456_Extrude.svg  style="width:24px;"> **Extrude** lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Curabitur at felis ut urna auctor pharetra id at nulla. This tool is part of the [external workbench](external_workbenches.md) called [Design456](Design456_Workbench.md).

## Usage

1.  Switch to the <img alt="" src=images/Design456_workbench_icon.svg  style="width:24px;"> [Design456](Design456_Workbench.md) workbench (install from <img alt="" src=images/Std_AddonMgr.svg  style="width:24px;"> [Addon Manager](Std_AddonMgr.md) is necessary, if not previously installed)
2.  Select a face, run the command <img alt="" src=images/Design456_Extrude.svg  style="width:24px;"> Extrude. It will ask you the length. After giving the length, the Extrude will be done.

## Limitations

Extrude doesn\'t work on 3D objects. This limitation is from the fact that many shapes are read-only in FreeCAD. You need to create a face, extrude the face, and later remove the face. You might merge them if you want. There is a tool in Design456 which does that job.
