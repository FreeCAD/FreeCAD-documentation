## Description

## Usage

1.  Select two shapes
2.  Press the **![](images/)_[Common](Part_Common.md)** button.

## Supported inputs 

Input objects must be [OpenCASCADE](OpenCASCADE.md) shapes. Examples: stuff made with Part, PartDesign, Sketcher workbenches. Not meshes (unless those were converted to shapes) - for meshes, there are specific Boolean tools in MeshDesign workbench.
