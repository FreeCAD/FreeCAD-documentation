Being parametric, document objects in FreeCAD can have a lot of additional properties, but these are the basic ones, present in every FreeCAD Document Object. Objects can be retrieved simply by their name. Example:  
```python
myObj = FreeCAD.ActiveDocument.myObjectName
print myObj.PropertiesList
```
