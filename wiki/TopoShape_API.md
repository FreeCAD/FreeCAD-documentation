# TopoShape API
**(November 2018) This information may be incomplete and outdated. For the latest API, see the [https://www.freecadweb.org/api autogenerated API documentation].**

The TopoShape is the mother object of the Part Module. All shape types (wire, face, solid, etc\...) of the Part module are TopoShapes, and share the following attributes and methods. Example:  
```python
import Part
sh = Part.makeBox(10,10,10)
print sh.Faces
for f in sh.Faces:
   print f.Edges
```

The underlying geometry of the following shapes may change to a curve which supports an edge of the shape, or a surface which supports a face of the shape. For example, a circle may be transformed into an ellipse when applying an affinity transformation. It may also happen that the circle then is represented as a b-spline curve. The transformation is applied to all the curves which support edges of the shape, and all the surfaces which support faces of the shape. Note: If you want to transform a shape without changing the underlying geometry then use the methods translate or rotate.|a TopoShape}}
