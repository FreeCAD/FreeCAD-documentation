# Installing on Linux
## Overview

The installation of FreeCAD on the most well-known Linux systems has been now endorsed by the community, and FreeCAD should be directly available via the package manager available on your distribution. The FreeCAD team also provides some:

-   \"Official\" packages when new releases are made
-   Experimental [Personal Package Archive](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PPA) (PPA) repositories, [AppImages](AppImage.md), and [Ubuntu Snaps](Ubuntu_Snap.md) for testing bleeding-edge features.

## Ubuntu and Ubuntu-based systems 

Many Linux distributions are based on Ubuntu and share its repositories. Besides official variants (Kubuntu, Lubuntu and Xubuntu), there are non official derivatives like Linux Mint, Voyager and others. The installation options below should be compatible with these systems. 


<div class="mw-collapsible-content">



### Official version 

FreeCAD is available from the Ubuntu Universe repository, and can be installed via the **Software Center** or from the terminal:

 
```python
sudo apt install freecad
```


**Note:**

the Ubuntu Universe package may be outdated as the packaging may lag behind the latest stable source code. In this case, it is suggested to install the package from the `-stable` PPA below. In addition, installing the `-daily` package can be done to test the development branch.

### Stable PPA version 

Personal Package Archive (PPA) for the stable FreeCAD release is maintained by the FreeCAD community on Launchpad. The Launchpad repository is called [FreeCAD Stable Releases](https://launchpad.net/~freecad-maintainers/+archive/freecad-stable) .

#### GUI

Install the stable PPA via the Graphical User Interface (GUI):

:   1\. Navigate to **Ubuntu Software → Software & Updates → Software Sources → Other Software**
:   2\. Click on **Add**, then copy and paste the following line



:   

    :   
        
```python
        ppa:freecad-maintainers/freecad-stable
        
```
        



:   3\. Add the source, close the dialog, and reload your software sources, if asked.

Now you can find and install the last stable FreeCAD version from the **Ubuntu Software Center**.

#### CLI

Install the stable PPA via the Command Line Interface (CLI):

:   1\. Add the PPA to your software sources:



:   

    :   
        
```python
        sudo add-apt-repository ppa:freecad-maintainers/freecad-stable
        
```
        



:   2\. Retrieve the updated package lists:



:   

    :   
        
```python
        sudo apt update
        
```
        



:   3\. Then install FreeCAD along with its offline documentation:



:   

    :   
        
```python
        sudo apt install freecad freecad-common
        
```
        




**Note:**

due to packaging problems, in certain versions of Ubuntu the `freecad-doc` package has collided with the installation of FreeCAD or one of its dependencies; if this is the case, remove the `freecad-doc` package, and only install the `freecad` package. If the `freecad-doc` package doesn\'t exist, then ignore it.

#### Checking Installation 

:   4\. Once you have the stable PPA added to your sources using one of the above methods, the `freecad` package will install this PPA version over the one provided by the Ubuntu Universe repository. You can see the available versions with the following `apt-cache` command:



:   
    
```python
    apt-cache policy freecad
    
```
    



:   The output should look similar to the following (of course the version info will vary):

 
```python
freecad:
  Installed: (none)
  Candidate: 2:0.18.4+dfsg1~201911060029~ubuntu18.04.1
  Version table:
     2:0.18.4+dfsg1~201911060029~ubuntu18.04.1 500
        500 http://ppa.launchpad.net/freecad-maintainers/freecad-stable/ubuntu bionic/main amd64 Packages
     0.16.6712+dfsg1-1ubuntu2 500
        500 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu bionic/universe amd64 Packages
ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ apt-cache policy freecad-doc
```

:   5\. Invoke the stable (PPA) version of FreeCAD from the GUI or CLI. The latter method is as follows:



:   
    
```python
    ./freecad
    
```
    



### Development PPA (Daily) 

As FreeCAD is in constant development, you may wish to install the **daily** package to keep with the latest improvements and bug fixes. The repository is also hosted on Launchpad and is called [freecad-daily](https://launchpad.net/~freecad-maintainers/+archive/freecad-daily).

This version is compiled daily from the official master repository. Please beware that although it will contain new features and bug fixes, it may also have newer bugs, and be unstable.

Add the daily PPA to your software sources, update the package lists, and install the daily package:  
```python
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:freecad-maintainers/freecad-daily
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install freecad-daily
```

Every day you can update to the latest daily:  
```python
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install freecad-daily
```


**Note:**

in some cases new code or dependencies added to FreeCAD will cause packaging errors; if this happens, a daily package may not be generated until the maintainers manually fix the problems. If you wish to continue testing the latest code, you should get the source code and compile FreeCAD directly; for instructions see [compiling](compiling.md).

Run the daily (PPA) version of FreeCAD: 

:   
    
```python
    freecad-daily
    
```

## Debian and other Debian-based systems 

Since Debian Lenny, FreeCAD is available directly from the Debian software repositories and can be installed via synaptic or simply with:

 
```python
sudo apt-get install freecad
``` 


<div class="mw-collapsible mw-collapsed toccolours">



## OpenSUSE

FreeCAD is typically installed with YAST (abbr. Yet another Setup Tool) the Linux operating system setup and configuration tool, or in any terminal/console (root rights required) with:



:   
    
```python
    zypper install FreeCAD
    
```
    




**Note:**

This procedure only covers the installation of officially released **stable** FreeCAD program versions, depending on the installed links to the program package repositories of your OS version. The openSUSE package *may be outdated* as the packaging may lag behind the latest stable source code. In this case, it is suggested to install the package manually from the below indicated (Expand) source repositories. 


<div class="mw-collapsible-content">



A vast release program for FreeCAD package builds are offered. Please visit for a survey:

**[Survey of repositories on openSUSE](https://software.opensuse.org/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&baseproject=ALL&q=FreeCAD)**

Generally for selecting the correct openSUSE distribution needed it is necessary to click on the particular **View** button.

### Stable

The stable package version: [Stable repositories on openSUSE](https://software.opensuse.org/package/FreeCAD). The correct openSUSE distribution version must be selected in the lower part of the web page.

Note: openSUSE has several options to choose from when downloading FreeCAD. To view these options, visit [Survey of stable repositories on openSUSE](https://software.opensuse.org/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&baseproject=ALL&q=FreeCAD).

### Development

Latest development releases AKA **unstable**: [Unstable repositories listings on openSUSE](https://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=science%3Aunstable&package=FreeCAD)

It is recommended to grab the binary packages directly. Then select the correct distribution for your installed openSUSE OS.

## Gentoo

FreeCAD can be built/installed simply by issuing:

 
```python
emerge freecad
``` 


<div class="mw-collapsible mw-collapsed toccolours">



## Fedora

FreeCAD has been included in the official Fedora packages since Fedora 20. It can be installed from the command line with:

 
```python
sudo dnf install freecad
``` 


<div class="mw-collapsible-content">

 On older Fedora releases, that was:

 
```python
sudo yum install freecad
```

The gui packages managers can also be used. Search for \"freecad\".

The official release package version tends to be well behind the FreeCAD releases. [Package: freecad](http://rpms.remirepo.net/rpmphp/zoom.php?rpm=freecad) shows the versions included in the Fedora repositories over time and versions.

More current versions can be obtained by downloading one of the [.AppImage](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/releases/) releases from the github repository. These work fine on Fedora.

If you want to keep up with the absolute latest daily builds, FreeCAD is also available on [copr](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/groups/g/freecad/coprs/) . To install the build from there, in a terminal session, enter:

 
```python
sudo dnf copr enable @freecad/nightly
sudo dnf install freecad
```

That leaves the copr repository active, so

 
```python
sudo dnf upgrade
```

or equivalent, will update to the latest FreeCAD build, along with updates from any of the other active repos. If you want something a bit more stable, you can disable \@freecad/nightly again after the initial install. The copr repository only keeps builds from the past 2 weeks. This is not a solution if you want to pick a specific older version.

Instructions are also available on [compile FreeCAD yourself](Compile_on_Linux.md), including a script specifically for Fedora. With a minor change, to checkout the specific commit from git, any version since about FreeCAD 0.15 can be built on any distribution since Fedora 21.

## Arch

Installing FreeCAD on Arch Linux and derivatives (ex. Manjaro):

 
```python
pacman -S freecad
```

## Other

If you find out that your system features FreeCAD but is not documented in this page, please tell us on the [forum](http://forum.freecadweb.org/viewforum.php?f=21)!

Many alternative, non-official FreeCAD packages are available on the net, for example for systems like slackware or fedora. A search on the net can quickly give you some results.

### Manual install on .deb based systems 

If for some reason you cannot use one of the above methods, you can always download one of the .deb packages available on the [Download](Download.md) page.
{{DownloadLinuxStable}}

Once you downloaded the .deb corresponding to your system version, if you have the [Gdebi](wikipedia:Debian#GDEBI.md) package installed (usually it is), you just need to navigate to where you downloaded the file, and double-click on it. The necessary dependencies will be taken care of automatically by your system package manager. Alternatively you can also install it from the terminal, navigating to where you downloaded the file, and type:

 
```python
sudo dpkg -i Name_of_your_FreeCAD_package.deb
```

changing Name\_of\_your\_FreeCAD\_package.deb by the name of the file you downloaded.

After you installed FreeCAD, a startup icon will be added in the \"Graphic\" section of your Start Menu.

### Installing on other Linux/Unix systems 

Many common Linux distros now include a precompiled FreeCAD as part of the standard packages. This is often out of date, but is a place to start. Check the standard package managers for your system. One of the following (partial) list of commands could install the official version of FreeCAD for your distro from the terminal. These probably need administrator privileges.

 
```python
apt-get install freecad
dnf install freecad
emerge freecad
slackpkg install freecad
yum install freecad
zypper install freecad
```

The package name is case sensitive, so try \[.AppImage](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/releases/) releases from the github repository. These tend to work on most 64 bit Linux distributions, without any special installation. Just make sure the downloaded file is marked as executable, then run it.

If that still is not good enough, and you cannot locate another source of a precompiled package for your situation, you will need to [compile FreeCAD yourself](Compile_on_Linux.md).

### Installing Windows Version on Linux 

See the [Installing on Windows](Installing_on_Windows.md) page.

## Next Step 

Once you\'ve got FreeCAD installed, it\'s time to [get started](Getting_started.md)!
