# Arch SetMaterial

## Description

This tool allows to add [materials](Material.md) to the active document and attribute a material to an [Arch](Arch_Workbench.md) object. A Material contains all the properties of a certain material and controls the color of the object it is attached to. Materials are stored in a **Materials** folder in the active document.
