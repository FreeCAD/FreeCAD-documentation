# Part Measure Angular

## Description

This command measures the angle between two straight edges, two planar faces or one straight edge and a planar face and displays the measurement in the [3D view](3D_view.md).

The appearance of the measurements can be changed in the [preferences](PartDesign_Preferences#Measure.md).

## Usage

1.  Select two straight edges, two planar faces or one straight edge
2.  There are several ways to invoke the command:
    -   Press the **<img src="images/Part_Measure_Angular.svg" width=16px> [Measure Angular](Part_Measure_Angular.md)** button.
    -   Select the **Measure → <img src="images/Part_Measure_Angular.svg" width=16px> Measure Angular‏‎** option from the menu.
3.  Alternatively the command can be launched without prior selection. A selection dialog then opens in the [Task panel](Task_panel.md). A Control widget also provides buttons to reset the selection, toggle the measurement display in the [3D view](3D_view.md), and clear all measurements.
4.  Measurements are automatically discarded when closing the document.

## Notes

-   You cannot use the [Draft](Draft_Workbench.md) snap tools with this command.
-   To add dimensions to drawings use the dimension tools from the [TechDraw Workbench](TechDraw_Workbench.md).
-   For more comprehensive measuring tools, install the <img alt="" src=images/Manipulator_workbench_icon.svg  style="width:24px;"> [Manipulator Workbench](Manipulator_Workbench.md) (an [external workbench](External_workbenches.md)).
