# Std Print

## Description

The **Std Print** command is primarily intended to print [TechDraw Workbench](TechDraw_Workbench.md) pages, but can also be used to print what is currently visible in the [3D view](3D_View.md).

## Usage

1.  If required activate the correct TechDraw page or change the 3D view to your liking.
2.  There are several ways to invoke the command:
    -   Select the **File → <img src="images/Std_Print.svg" width=16px> Print...** option from the menu.
    -   Use the keyboard shortcut: **Ctrl**+**P**.
3.  The standard print dialog box will pop up.

## Options

-   Press **Esc** or the **Cancel** button to abort the command.

## Notes

-   When printing the contents of the 3D view, one should not expect any particular scale factor in the output.
