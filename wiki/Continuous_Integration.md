# Continuous Integration
## Continuous Integration 

Currently the FreeCAD repository on GitHub will trigger a build on the below two CI systems. Between these systems pretty much all the main cross-platforms OSs are coveredː Linux, macOS, and Windows. CIs can also be used to run [unit tests](Testing.md).

### TravisCI

<img alt="" src=images/Travis-logo.png  style="width:50px;"> Tests against Linux and macOS. The config file is called [.travis.yml](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/blob/master/.travis.yml) and it lives in the top directory of FreeCAD. To view current and past buildsː <https://travis-ci.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/builds>

### Appveyor

<img alt="" src=images/Appveyor.svg  style="width:40px;"> Tests against Windows. The config file is called [appveyor.yml](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/blob/master/appveyor.yml) and it lives in the top directory of FreeCAD. To view current and previous Appveyor buildsː <https://ci.appveyor.com/project/yorikvanhavre/freecad/history>

## Tips

\- If you add [skip ci] or [ci skip] to a git commit it will cancel a CI build.
