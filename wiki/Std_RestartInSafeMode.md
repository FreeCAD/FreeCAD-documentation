# Std RestartInSafeMode

## Description

The **Std RestartInSafeMode** command restarts FreeCAD in a *factory reset* state for debugging. It temporarily disables user configurations, addons, themes and other customizations.

## Usage

1.  Select the **Help → <img src="images/Std_RestartInSafeMode.svg" width=16px>Restart in safe mode** option from the menu.
2.  A warning dialog box opens.
3.  Press the **Yes** button to confirm.
4.  FreeCAD is restarted in safe mode.
5.  Restart FreeCAD again to exit safe mode

## Notes

-   Safe mode can also be invoked from the Command Line Interface (CLI) using the {{Incode|--safe-mode}} flag. See [Start up and Configuration](Start_up_and_Configuration.md).
