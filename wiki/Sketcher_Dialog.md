# Sketcher Dialog
## Introduction

While a sketch is being edited, or, in other words, while a sketch is in edit mode, the Sketcher Dialog is displayed on the Task tab of the [Combo view](Combo_view.md).

To put a sketch in edit mode do one of the following:

-   Double-click the sketch in the [Tree view](Tree_view.md).
-   Right-click the sketch in the Tree view and select **[Edit sketch](Sketcher_EditSketch.md)** from the context menu.
-   Select the sketch and press the **<img src="images/Sketcher_EditSketch.svg" width=16px> [Edit sketch](Sketcher_EditSketch.md)** button.
-   Select the sketch and then select the **<img src="images/Sketcher_EditSketch.svg" width=16px> [Edit sketch](Sketcher_EditSketch.md)** option from the menu.

The dialog consists of the following sections:

## Solver messages 

This section informs about the state of the sketch. A sketch can be under constrained, fully constrained or have redundant constrains.

If a sketch is under constrained the number of degrees of freedom (or Dofs) is indicated. Clicking this text will select the under constrained sketch elements.

If a sketch has redundant constraints the indices of the constraints are indicated. Clicking that text will select these constraints.

## Advanced solver control 

This section will only appear if you check the **Show section \'Advanced solver control**\' option in the [sketcher preferences](Sketcher_Preferences.md).

Note that most of the options in this section are of no practical use. They can however help with testing and understanding the solvers.

|                              | During diagnosing the rank of the matrix is calculated which enables to further analyze the constraint system to determine if there are redundant/conflicting constraints. The rank revealing decomposition used in FreeCAD is QR. There are two algorithms: **Eigen Dense QR** is a dense matrix QR with full pivoting, which is the legacy proven algorithm that works very well but it is rather slow as the system grows. The **Eigen Sparse QR** algorithm is an optimization for sparse matrices (having lots of zeros), which is usually much faster, since FreeCAD\'s systems do have a lot of zeros. |
