This tool saves the current Drawing sheet as an SVG (scalable vector graphics) file. Such a file can then be edited in a scalable vector graphics program such as [Inkscape](http://www.inkscape.org).

SVG files are common and can be viewed in most modern browsers and image viewers. It can be a useful way to share a design with people who don\'t have FreeCAD installed on their PC.
