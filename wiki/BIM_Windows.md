# BIM Windows

## Description

The BIM windows manager dialog allows you to browse and modify all the [windows and doors](Arch_Window.md) of your project together. This is often more convenient than editing them one by one, and allows you to make sure that they all have the parameters you require correctly set, such as tag, dimensions, description or material.
