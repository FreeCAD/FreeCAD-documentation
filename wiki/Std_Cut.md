# Std Cut

## Description

The **Std Cut** command is limited   * it can only be used for [spreadsheet cells](Spreadsheet_Workbench.md). The command copies the contents and properties of cells to the Clipboard and then clears them.

To cut other objects you can use the [Std Copy](Std_Copy.md) command followed by a delete operation.

## Usage

1.  Select one or more cells in the spreadsheet.
2.  There are several ways to invoke the command   *
    -   Press the **<img src="images/Std_Cut.svg" width=16px> [Std Cut](Std_Cut.md)** button.
    -   Select the **Edit → <img src="images/Std_Cut.svg" width=16px> Cut** option from the menu.

## Notes

-   The standard keyboard shortcut **Ctrl**+**X** does not call the **Std Cut** command but uses the Cut function from the OS instead. You can use this shortcut in most FreeCAD text windows and input boxes, it also works for spreadsheet cells.
