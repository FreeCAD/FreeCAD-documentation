# Unified Measurement Facility
This page is describes a potential Google Summer of Code project regarding upgrades to FreeCAD\'s measurement functions.

## Outline

There are currently several ways of measuring objects in FreeCAD: Draft Dimensions, TechDraw Dimensions, Manipulator Caliper, Measure Distance, Measure Linear, etc. A single method of measuring objects would smooth workflow and reduce learning time.

## Details

1.  Individual workbenches have created measurement tools that filled the needs of that workbench only.
2.  New users find the diversity of measuring tools confusing.
3.  Work must be repeated, for example in creating a Dimension in a drawing when the corresponding measurement already exists in the 3D model.

## Expected Outcome 

1.  A intuitive measurement facility.

## Future Possibilities 

This work will provide an introduction to the FreeCAD code base and the use of supporting software such as OpenCascade and Qt.
