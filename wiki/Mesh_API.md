# Mesh API
**(November 2018) This information may be incomplete and outdated. For the latest API, see the [https://www.freecadweb.org/api autogenerated API documentation].**

The Mesh objects can be manipulated by adding new facets, deleting facets, importing from an STL file, transforming the mesh and much more. For a complete overview of what can be done see also the [Mesh Workbench](Mesh_Workbench.md) documentation. A mesh object cannot be added to an existing document directly. Therefore the document must create an object with a property class that supports meshes. Example:


```python
m = Mesh.Mesh()
... # Manipulate the mesh
d = FreeCAD.activeDocument() # Get a reference to the actie document
f = d.addObject("Mesh::Feature", "Mesh") # Create a mesh feature
f.Mesh = m # Assign the mesh object to the internal property
d.recompute()
```
