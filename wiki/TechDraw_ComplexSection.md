# TechDraw ComplexSection

## Description

The <img alt="" src=images/TechDraw_ComplexSection.svg  style="width:24px;"> **TechDraw ComplexSection** tool inserts a cross-section view based on an existing part view and a profile.

 <img alt="" src=images/TechDraw_QuarterSection_example.png  style="width:350px;">  
*A Quarter section view created with the Complex Section tool*

 <img alt="" src=images/TechDraw_AlignedSection_example.png  style="width:350px;">  
*An Aligned section view created with the Complex Section tool*

 <img alt="" src=images/TechDraw_OffsetSection_example.png  style="width:350px;">  
*An Offset section view created with the Complex Section tool*

## Usage

1.  Select a part view and a profile object in the [3D view](3D_view.md) or [Tree view](Tree_view.md). Profiles are typically Sketches, but any object whose shape can be made into a wire will work.
2.  There are several ways to invoke the tool:
    -   Press the **<img src="images/TechDraw_ComplexSection.svg" width=16px> [Insert Complex Section](TechDraw_ComplexSection.md)** button.
    -   Select the **TechDraw → <img src="images/TechDraw_ComplexSection.svg" width=16px> Insert Complex Section** option from the menu.
3.  A task panel will open which will help calculate the various properties. Reasonable values for the view Direction are calculated, but these can be changed.

### Data


{{TitleProperty|Cutting Tool}}

-    **Cutting Tool Wire Object**: The document object whose shape will be used to generate the cutting profile.

-    **Projection Strategy**: Controls how the cut is performed and how the result is projected on the page:

    -   
        {{Value|Offset}}
        
        : Performs a simple cut of the Source shape and projects the result.

    -   
        {{Value|Aligned}}
        
        : Cuts the Source shape using a tool created from each segment (edge) of the cutting profile. The results of each cut are projected in a vertical or horizontal array, depending on the orientation of the cutting profile.

    -   
        {{Value|NoParallel}}
        
        : As Aligned, but profile segments which are parallel to the view direction are skipped.

## Notes

See [TechDraw SectionView](TechDraw_SectionView#Notes.md)

## Scripting

See also: [Autogenerated API documentation](https://freecad.github.io/SourceDoc/) and [FreeCAD Scripting Basics](FreeCAD_Scripting_Basics.md).

The ComplexSection tool can be used in [macros](Macros.md) and from the [Python](Python.md) console by using the following functions:

 
```python
doc = FreeCAD.ActiveDocument
box = doc.Box
profile = doc.Sketch
page = doc.Page

view = doc.addObject("TechDraw::DrawViewPart", "View")
page.addView(view)
view.Source = box
view.Direction = (0.0, 0.0, 1.0)

section = doc.addObject("TechDraw::DrawComplexSection", "ComplexSection")
page.addView(section)
section.BaseView = view
section.CuttingToolWireObject = profile
section.Direction = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0)
section.SectionNormal = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0)
```
