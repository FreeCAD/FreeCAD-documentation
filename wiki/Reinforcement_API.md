# Reinforcement API
**(November 2018) The [[Reinforcement Addon]] is developed separately from the [[Arch Workbench]]. Its code and API is hosted in the [https://github.com/amrit3701/FreeCAD-Reinforcement FreeCAD-Reinforcement] repository, which is separate from the main FreeCAD repository.**

See also the [Arch API](Arch_API.md) for the main [Arch Workbench](Arch_Workbench.md) functions.

The functions of the API can be used in [macros](macros.md) and from the [Python](Python.md) console once the respective module has been imported.  
```python
import StraightRebar
import UShapeRebar
import LShapeRebar
import BentShapeRebar
import Stirrup
import HelicalRebar
```
