Boolean Overlap constructs a shape that covers the space occupied by no less than \'OverlapIndex\' shapes. \'OverlapIndex\' is a property that can be modified. Value of 1 gives the result equivalent to [Part Fuse](Part_Fuse.md). Value equal to number of shapes makes the tool equivalent to [Part Common](Part_Common.md). Default value is 2, meaning the result will fill space where there is any overlap.

Requires FreeCAD v0.17+ built against OCC no less than 6.9.0 (tested on 7.0.0).

## Installation:

download MacroOverlap.py and save it in macro directory:



<https://github.com/DeepSOIC/FreeCAD-Macros/raw/master/Overlap/MacroOverlap.py>



## How to use: 

1.  Select three\* or more shapes to compute overlap between. You can also select a single compound containing the argument shapes.
2.  In FreeCAD menu: Macro → Macros\... → double-click MacroOverlap.py . A new object will be created.
3.  Select the new object, and modify \'Overlap Index\' property in property editor (Data tab), if necessary.

\* two shapes will do, too, but the action of tool will be equivalent to either [Part Common](Part_Common.md) or [Part Fuse](Part_Fuse.md), and so it is recommended to use Part tools instead.
