    -   Select the **View → Standard views → <img src="images/Std_ViewRotateLeft.svg" width=16px> Rotate Left** option from the menu.
    -   Select the **Standard views → <img src="images/Std_ViewRotateLeft.svg" width=16px> Rotate Left** option from the [3D view](3D_view.md) context menu.

import FreeCADGui

view = FreeCADGui.ActiveDocument.ActiveView
view.viewRotateLeft()
```
