# Std TreeSyncView

## Description

The **Std TreeSyncView** command toggles the [Tree view](Tree_view.md) SyncView mode. If this mode is on, selecting an object from a different document in the Tree view automatically activates that document's last used docked [3D view](3D_view.md).

## Usage

1.  There are several ways to invoke the command:
    -   Click on the black down arrow to the right of the **<img src="images/Std_TreeSyncView.svg" width=16px>** button and select the **Sync view** option from the flyout. Note: the button image will change depending on the selected option.
    -   Select the **View → TreeView actions → Sync view** option from the menu.
    -   Use the keyboard shortcut: **T** then **1**.

## Preferences

See also: [Preferences Editor](Preferences_Editor.md).

The Tree view SyncView mode can also be set in the preferences: **Edit → Preferences → General → Selection → Auto switch to the 3D view containing the selected item**.
