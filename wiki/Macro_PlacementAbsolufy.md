## Description

### Context

This macro has been written mainly to circumvent unfinished Part container implementation that can lead to absolute position shift, mainly when exporting parts. This is due to fact that Part containers creates a local coordinate system that can be shifted from global one. This local referential is then used by subsequent objects but isn\'t correctly handled by several functions (eg. export).

## Usage

Functionally, the macro will reset the Part containers placement to global origin while preserving the objects absolute position. Notice that PlacementAbsolufy macro applies to the whole active document.

To use the macro, just run it when the document on which it shall be applied is open.

## Installation

The macro is available through [Addon Manager](Std_AddonMgr.md). Code is provided on this page for convenience in case user system doesn\'t have git-python. Though it should be up-to-date, latest release is always available at [FreeCAD-macro repository](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-macros/blob/master/Utility/PlacementAbsolufy.FCMacro)

For more detailed explanations, see the [How to install macros](How_to_install_macros.md) page.
