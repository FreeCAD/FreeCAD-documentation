# Draft Join

## Description

The <img alt="" src=images/Draft_Join.svg  style="width:24px;"> **Draft Join** command joins [Draft Lines](Draft_Line.md) and [Draft Wires](Draft_Wire.md) into a single wire. This command is the counterpart of the [Draft Split](Draft_Split.md) command.

## Usage

1.  The end points of the [Draft Lines](Draft_Line.md) and/or [Draft Wires](Draft_Wire.md) to be joined must be exactly coincident. If required first adjust points to ensure that this is the case.
2.  Select two or more [Draft Lines](Draft_Line.md) and/or [Draft Wires](Draft_Wire.md).
3.  There are several ways to invoke the command:
    -   Press the **<img src="images/Draft_Join.svg" width=16px> [Draft Join](Draft_Join.md)** button.
    -   Select the **Modification → <img src="images/Draft_Join.svg" width=16px> Join** option from the menu.
    -   Use the keyboard shortcut: **J** then **O**.

## Notes

-   [Draft Lines](Draft_Line.md) and [Draft Wires](Draft_Wire.md) can also be joined with the [Draft Wire](Draft_Wire.md) command or the [Draft Upgrade](Draft_Upgrade.md) command.
-   To join objects that are not [Draft Lines](Draft_Line.md) or [Draft Wires](Draft_Wire.md) you can try using [Draft Upgrade](Draft_Upgrade.md) and/or [Draft Downgrade](Draft_Downgrade.md) on them one or more times first.

## Scripting

See also: [Autogenerated API documentation](https://freecad.github.io/SourceDoc/) and [FreeCAD Scripting Basics](FreeCAD_Scripting_Basics.md).

To join wires use the `join_wires` method (<small>(v0.19)</small> ) of the Draft module. This methods replaces the deprecated `joinWires` method. This method returns `None`.

 
```python
join_wires(wires)
```

-    `wires`is a list of wire objects to be joined.

Example:

 
```python
import FreeCAD as App
import Draft

doc = App.newDocument()

p1 = App.Vector(0, 0, 0)
p2 = App.Vector(500, 0, 0)
p3 = App.Vector(500, 500, 0)
p4 = App.Vector(0, 500, 0)

wire1 = Draft.make_wire([p1, p2])
wire2 = Draft.make_wire([p2, p3])
wire3 = Draft.make_wire([p3, p4])
wire4 = Draft.make_wire([p4, p1])

Draft.join_wires([wire1, wire3, wire2, wire4])
doc.recompute()
```
