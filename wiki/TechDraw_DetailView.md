*Detail view with circular viewbox of an existing view*

## Usage

-   Select a view in the page or tree.
-   Press the **<img src="images/TechDraw_DetailView.svg" width=16px> [Insert Detail View](TechDraw_DetailView.md)** button to create the detail view.
-   In the appearing task dialog you can define the radius of the view box, the scale and the view position. For the latter you can do this
    -   either by changing the coordinates
    -   or by pressing the button **Drag Highlight**. In this case the detail origin border is highlighted bold and with the label *drag*. Click on the border or the label, keep the mouse button pressed and drag it to the position you like. Finally release the mouse to accept the change.

The Detail view can be displayed within a round or square view box. This is controlled by the [preferences](TechDraw_Preferences#Annotation.md) setting **Detail View Outline Shape**.
