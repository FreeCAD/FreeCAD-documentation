# Part Point

## Description

A <img alt="" src=images/Part_Point.svg  style="width:24px;"> **Part Point** is a parametric point that can be created with the <img alt="" src=images/Part_Primitives.svg  style="width:24px;"> [Part Primitives](Part_Primitives.md) command. Its coordinates are relative to the coordinate system defined by its **Placement** property.

## Usage

See [Part Primitives](Part_Primitives#Usage.md).

## Properties

See also: [Property editor](Property_editor.md).

A Part Point object is derived from a [Part Feature](Part_Feature.md) object and inherits all its properties. It also has the following additional properties:

### Data


{{TitleProperty|Attachment}}

The object has the same attachment properties as a [Part Part2DObject](Part_Part2DObject#Data.md).


{{TitleProperty|Base}}

-    **X|Distance**: The X coordinate of the point. The default is {{Value|0mm}}.

-    **Y|Distance**: The Y coordinate of the point. The default is {{Value|0mm}}.

-    **Z|Distance**: The Z coordinate of the point. The default is {{Value|0mm}}.

## Scripting

See also: [Autogenerated API documentation](https://freecad.github.io/SourceDoc/), [Part scripting](Part_scripting.md) and [FreeCAD Scripting Basics](FreeCAD_Scripting_Basics.md).

A Part Point can be created with the {{Incode|addObject()}} method of the document:

 
```python
point = FreeCAD.ActiveDocument.addObject("Part::Vertex", "myPoint")
```

-   Where {{Incode|"myPoint"}} is the name for the object.
-   The function returns the newly created object.

Example:

 
```python
import FreeCAD as App

doc = App.activeDocument()

point = doc.addObject("Part::Vertex", "myPoint")
point.X = 1
point.Y = 2
point.Z = 3

doc.recompute()
```
