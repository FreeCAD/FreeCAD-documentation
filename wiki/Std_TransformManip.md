# Std TransformManip

## Description

This tool allows you to apply rotation increments or translation increments to an object.

## Usage

1.  Right-click on the object in the model [tree view](Tree_view.md). For some objects the tool is also available via double-clicking the object in the model tree.
    -   Press and hold the left mouse button on an axis arrow and drag to translate the object in that direction.
    -   Press and hold the left mouse button on a sphere and drag to rotate the object in that axis.
    -   The Increments parameters in the [Task panel](Task_panel.md) allow one to define the movement with precision
2.  The **OK** button allows you to quit the utility easily.

## Notes

-   As soon as you rotate/move the object in the [3D view](3D_view.md), changes are applied.
-   There is no Cancel button. Pressing **OK** only serves to exit the utility.
-   It\'s possible to <img alt="" src=images/Std_Undo.svg  style="width:20px;"> [undo](Std_Undo.md) changes afterwards.
-   The value boxes are for increments, not absolute values.
