# Draft Preferences
The preferences for the [Draft Workbench](Draft_Workbench.md) can be found in the [Preferences Editor](Preferences_Editor.md). In the menu select **Edit → Preferences...** and then **Draft**.

There are five pages: [General](#General.md), [Interface](#Interface.md), [Grid and snapping](#Grid_and_snapping.md), [Visual](#Visual.md) and [Texts and dimensions](#Texts_and_dimensions.md).

Some advanced preferences can only be changed in the [Parameter editor](Std_DlgParameter.md). See [Fine-tuning](Fine-tuning#Draft_Workbench.md).

This page has been updated for version 0.22.

In {{VersionMinus|0.21}} some preferences may appear on a different page, and in some cases FreeCAD must be restarted after changing a preference.

## General

On the this page you can specify the following:
