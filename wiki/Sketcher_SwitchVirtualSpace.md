# Sketcher SwitchVirtualSpace

## Description

The FreeCAD Sketcher has two virtual spaces on which constraints can be set. Usually all constraints gets set on virtual space one. You can move some constraints to virtual space two. This can help to inspect only on a few constraints at a time.

## Usage

To move constraints to the other virtual space:

1.  Select constraints you want to move.
2.  Press the **[<img src=images/Sketcher_SwitchVirtualSpace.svg style="width:16px"> [Switch virtual space](Sketcher_SwitchVirtualSpace.md)** button.

To switch the virtual space:

1.  Make sure you have no constraint selected.
2.  Press the **[<img src=images/Sketcher_SwitchVirtualSpace.svg style="width:16px"> [Switch virtual space](Sketcher_SwitchVirtualSpace.md)** button.


**Note:**

if you decide to set constraints on the second virtual space, don\'t forget about them later on if you don\'t see them in the [3D view](3D_view.md).
