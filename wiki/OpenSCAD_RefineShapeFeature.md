# OpenSCAD RefineShapeFeature

## Description

Cleans unnecessary lines. After a Boolean operation, some lines defining the previous form remain visible, this tool creates a copy of the totally cleaned.

## Usage

1.  Select the shape to be cleaned.
2.  Click the **OpenSCAD → Refine shape** menu.

-   A parent-object is created and totally cleaned, the original object is rendered hidden.

## Limitations

-   The refinement algorithm only works on shells. Therefore it iterates over the shells of the input shape and then for each shell it creates a new shell with joined faces wherever possible. This means if your input shape is only a face, wire, edge or vertex then the algorithm does nothing.
-   As opposed to <img alt="" src=images/Part_RefineShape.svg  style="width:24px;"> [Part RefineShape](Part_RefineShape.md) in the <img alt="" src=images/Workbench_Part.svg  style="width:24px;"> [Part Workbench](Part_Workbench.md), this feature **WILL** update when the underlying shapes are changed.

## Notes

-   the function does not modify the existing shape, but returns a new shape.
-   the function is normally used as last step in the modelling history.
-   the function can help to get difficult fillets to work.
-   the function is intended to stop 3D printers from printing unwanted edges.
