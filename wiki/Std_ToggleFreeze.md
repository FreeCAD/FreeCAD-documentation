## Description

The **Std ToggleFreeze** command toggles the freeze state of objects. A frozen object is not recomputed when the objects it depends on change. The freeze state of objects is not stored in the document.

## Usage

2.  Select the **<img src="images/Std_ToggleFreeze.svg" width=16px> Toggle freeze** option from the [Tree view](Tree_view.md) context menu.
3.  Frozen objects are marked with the command icon in the Tree view.
4.  If objects have been thawed: optionally [recompute](Std_Refresh.md) the document.
