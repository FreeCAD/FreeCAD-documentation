# Assembly3 ConstraintPointsHorizontal

## Description

This tool builds a link between two or three objects of an assembly. The selected elements of each object or more precisely their implicit coordinate systems (ICS) are used to position one object to another.

Based on one planar element\'s ICS both other elements\' ICSs\' origins are positioned to have identical y-coordinates.

## Usage

1.  Place two objects into an assembly
2.  Select two point elements of one object
3.  Select a planar face element of the second object
4.  Press the **<img src="images/Assembly_ConstraintPointsHorizontal.svg" width=16px> [Points horizontal](Assembly3_ConstraintPointsHorizontal.md)** button.

Or

1.  Place three objects into an assembly
2.  Select one point element of the first two objects
3.  Select a planar face element of the third object
4.  Press the **<img src="images/Assembly_ConstraintPointsHorizontal.svg" width=16px> [Points horizontal](Assembly3_ConstraintPointsHorizontal.md)** button.
