# Developing FreeCAD with KDevelop
## Introduction

The intention for this page is to help orient users who are inclined toward understanding and reading FreeCAD source code with the possible end goal of contributing eventually to the project.

## Prerequisites

-   (optional) an account on github or gitlab (or another 3rd party source code hosting services). Note   * as of this edit, FreeCAD uses Github.
-   An up to date version of [KDevelop](https   *//www.kdevelop.org/)
-   Some basic understanding about `git` (see [Source code management](Source_code_management.md))
