# Parts Library Workbench

 

## Introduction

 

This repository contains a library of Parts to be used in FreeCAD. It is maintained by the community of users of FreeCAD and is not part of the FreeCAD project, although it is made with the aim to be used as a repository of parts by FreeCAD in the future.

The library is a simple container for FreeCAD (.fcstd) and STEP (.stp) files. You can download it anywhere and import its files in your FreeCAD projects. Inside the library, there is also a FreeCAD macro (PartsLibrary.FCMacro) that you can place in your FreeCAD macros folder. That macro creates a browser window inside FreeCAD, from which you can easily add the parts by double-clicking them.
