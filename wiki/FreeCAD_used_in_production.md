# FreeCAD used in production
## Overview

 

Follow-up to the **Thread: List of firms/companies/organizations that use FreeCAD in Production or in their workflow** ([forum thread](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=43604)) this wiki page has been created to tracker all for-profit and non-profit public and private sector usage of FreeCAD in a production environment. The main intention is to debunk the stigma/perception that FreeCAD isn\'t stable or reliable enough to run in a production environment.
