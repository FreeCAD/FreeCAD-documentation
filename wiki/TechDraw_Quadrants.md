# TechDraw Quadrants

## Description

The **TechDraw Quadrant** tool adds three [cosmetic vertices](TechDraw_CosmeticVertex.md) along the length of one or more selected edges. The vertices are placed at 25%, 50% and 75% of the length of the edges. For a circular edge this results in cosmetic vertices at 90°, 180° and 270°, in addition to its geometric vertex at 0°.

## Usage

1.  Select one or more edges in a view. Any edge can be selected, not just circles.
2.  There are several ways to invoke the tool:
    -   Press the **<img src="images/TechDraw_Quadrants.svg" width=16px> [Add Quadrant Vertices](TechDraw_Quadrants.md)** button.
    -   Select the **TechDraw → Add Vertices → <img src="images/TechDraw_Quadrants.svg" width=16px> Add Quadrant Vertices** option from the menu.

## Notes

-   The created cosmetic vertices are not parametrically linked to the selected edges.
-   To delete a cosmetic vertex use <img alt="" src=images/TechDraw_CosmeticEraser.svg  style="width:16px;"> [TechDraw CosmeticEraser](TechDraw_CosmeticEraser.md).

## Properties

Cosmetic vertices have no properties of their own, as they are not document objects. They share color and size settings with regular geometry vertices.

## Scripting

See also: [Autogenerated API documentation](https://freecad.github.io/SourceDoc/) and [FreeCAD Scripting Basics](FreeCAD_Scripting_Basics.md).

Cosmetic vertices are not accessible from [macros](Macros.md) or the [Python](Python.md) console at this time. This snippet will remove all cosmetic vertices from the view.

 
```python
v = App.ActiveDocument.View
v.clearCV()
App.ActiveDocument.recompute()
```
