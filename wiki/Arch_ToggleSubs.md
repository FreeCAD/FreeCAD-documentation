## Description

This tools toggles the visibility of all the subtractions of an [Arch](Arch_Workbench.md) object between visible and hidden.

Normally, if an Arch object, like an [Arch Wall](Arch_Wall.md), is selected and you press **Space** only the external wall will be hidden or made visible, but not the internal objects.

With this tool, the internal subtracted objects will all become visible or hidden.

## Usage

1.  Select an Arch object that has subtractions.
2.  Select menu {{MenuCommand|Arch → Utilities → <img src="images/Arch_ToggleSubs‏‎.svg" width=16px> [Toggle Subcomponents‏‎](Arch_ToggleSubs‏‎.md)}}.

## Options

The color of a subtraction element can follow the style of [Draft construction](Draft_ToggleConstructionMode.md) elements, by activating the appropriate option in the [Arch Preferences](Arch_Preferences.md), in the menu {{MenuCommand|Edit → Preferences → Arch → General settings → Apply Draft construction style to subcomponents}}.

The [Draft construction](Draft_ToggleConstructionMode.md) style can be set in the [Draft Preferences](Draft_Preferences.md), in the menu {{MenuCommand|Preferences → Draft → General Draft}}.
