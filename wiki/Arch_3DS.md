# Arch 3DS
## Description

The Arch Workbench supports importing [3DS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.3ds) files. The 3DS format is ancient but still widely used on the internet. It can contain mesh data and material information. At the moment, it will import mesh objects contained in the file as FreeCAD mesh objects, and has no support for materials yet.
