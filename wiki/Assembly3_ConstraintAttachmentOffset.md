# Assembly3 ConstraintAttachmentOffset

## Description

This tool builds a link between two objects of an assembly and fixes the distance between them and their orientation to each other. The selected elements of each object or more precisely their element coordinate systems (ECS) are used to fix the current relative position of the objects.

This link leaves no degree of freedom (DOF) unconstrained.

## Usage

1.  Place two objects into an assembly.
2.  Select one element of each object.
3.  Press the **<img src="images/Assembly_ConstraintAttachmentOffset.svg‎‎" width=16px> [Create "AttachmentOffset" constraint](Assembly3_ConstraintAttachmentOffset.md)** button.
4.  Both objects remain at their position.
