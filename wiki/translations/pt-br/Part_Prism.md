# Part Prism/pt-br

## Description

A <img alt="" src=images/Part_Prism.svg  style="width:24px;"> **Part Prism** is a parametric solid that can be created with the <img alt="" src=images/Part_Primitives.svg  style="width:24px;"> [Part Primitives](Part_Primitives.md) command. It is the result of extruding a regular polygon along a straight path. In the coordinate system defined by its **Placement** property, the bottom face of the prism lies on the XY plane with its center at the origin and one of its vertices on the X axis.

## Usage

See [Part Primitives](Part_Primitives#Usage.md).

## Example

![Part Prism from the scripting example](images/Part_Prism_Scripting_Example.png )

A Part Prism object created with the [scripting example](#Scripting.md) below is shown here.

## Properties

See also: [Property editor](Property_editor.md).

A Part Prism object is derived from a [Part Feature](Part_Feature.md) object and inherits all its properties. It also has the following additional properties:

### Data


{{TitleProperty|Attachment}}

The object has the same attachment properties as a [Part Part2DObject](Part_Part2DObject#Data.md).


{{TitleProperty|Prism}}

-    **Polygon|IntegerConstraint**: The number of sides of the polygon. The default is {{Value|6}}.

-    **Circumradius|Length**: The radius of the circle that circumscribes the polygon, the distance from the center of the polygon to one of its vertices. The default is {{Value|2mm}}.

-    **Height|Length**: The height of the prism. The default is {{Value|10mm}}.

-    **First Angle|Angle**: The angle between the extrusion direction of the prism and its positive Z axis, measured around its Y axis. The angle is positive towards its positive X axis. Valid range: {{Value|0° &lt;&#61; value &lt; 90°}}. The default is {{Value|0°}}.

-    **Second Angle|Angle**: The angle between the extrusion direction of the prism and its positive Z axis, measured around its X axis. The angle is positive towards its positive Y axis. Valid range: {{Value|0° &lt;&#61; value &lt; 90°}}. The default is {{Value|0°}}.

## Scripting

See also: [Autogenerated API documentation](https://freecad.github.io/SourceDoc/), [Part scripting](Part_scripting.md) and [FreeCAD Scripting Basics](FreeCAD_Scripting_Basics.md).

A Part Prism can be created with the {{Incode|addObject()}} method of the document:


```python
prism = FreeCAD.ActiveDocument.addObject("Part::Prism", "myPrism")
```

-   Where {{Incode|"myPrism"}} is the name for the object.
-   The function returns the newly created object.

Example:


```python
import FreeCAD as App

doc = App.activeDocument()

prism = doc.addObject("Part::Prism", "myPrism")
prism.Polygon = 5
prism.Circumradius = 10
prism.Height = 50
prism.FirstAngle = 22.5
prism.SecondAngle = 45
prism.Placement = App.Placement(App.Vector(1, 2, 3), App.Rotation(60, 75, 30))

doc.recompute()
```
