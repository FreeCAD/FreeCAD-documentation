# Part Cone/pt-br

## Description

The <img alt="" src=images/Part_Cone.svg  style="width:24px;"> **Part Cone** command creates a parametric cone solid. In the coordinate system defined by its **Placement** property, the bottom face of the cone lies on the XY plane with its center at the origin.

The default Part Cone is truncated. It can be turned into a full, untruncated, cone by changing its **Radius1** or **Radius2** property to zero. It can be turned into a segment of a cone by changing its **Angle** property.

## Usage

1.  There are several ways to invoke the command:
    -   Press the **<img src="images/Part_Cone.svg" width=16px> [Part Cone](Part_Cone.md)** button.
    -   Select the **Part → Primitives → <img src="images/Part_Cone.svg" width=16px> Cone** option from the menu.
2.  The cone is created.
3.  Optionally change the dimensions and **Placement** of the cone by doing one of the following:
    -   Double-click the object in the [Tree view](Tree_view.md):
        1.  The **Geometric Primitives** task panel opens.
        2.  Change one or more properties.
        3.  The object is dynamically updated in the [3D view](3D_view.md).
        4.  Press the **OK** button.
    -   Change the properties in the [Property editor](Property_editor.md).
    -   Change the **Placement** with the <img alt="" src=images/Std_TransformManip.svg  style="width:16px;"> [Std TransformManip](Std_TransformManip.md) command.

## Example

![Part Cone from the scripting example](images/Part_Cone_Scripting_Example.png )

A Part Cone object created with the [scripting example](#Scripting.md) below is shown here.

## Notes

-   A Part Cone can also be created with the <img alt="" src=images/Part_Primitives.svg  style="width:16px;"> [Part Primitives](Part_Primitives.md) command. With that command you can specify the dimensions and placement at creation time.

## Properties

See also: [Property editor](Property_editor.md).

A Part Cone object is derived from a [Part Feature](Part_Feature.md) object and inherits all its properties. It also has the following additional properties:

### Data


{{TitleProperty|Attachment}}

The object has the same attachment properties as a [Part Part2DObject](Part_Part2DObject#Data.md).


{{TitleProperty|Cone}}

-    **Radius1|Length**: The radius of the bottom face of the cone. Can be {{Value|0mm}} if **Radius2** is larger than {{Value|0mm}}. The default is {{Value|2mm}}.

-    **Radius2|Length**: The radius of the top face of the cone. Can be {{Value|0mm}} if **Radius1** is larger than {{Value|0mm}}. The default is {{Value|4mm}}.

-    **Height|Length**: The height of the cone. The default is {{Value|10mm}}.

-    **Angle|Angle**: The angle of the circular arc that defines the top and bottom face of the cone. Valid range: {{Value|0° &lt; value &lt;&#61; 360°}}. The default is {{Value|360°}}. If it is smaller than {{Value|360°}} the resulting solid will be a segment of a cone.

## Scripting

See also: [Autogenerated API documentation](https://freecad.github.io/SourceDoc/), [Part scripting](Part_scripting.md) and [FreeCAD Scripting Basics](FreeCAD_Scripting_Basics.md).

A Part Cone can be created with the {{Incode|addObject()}} method of the document:


```python
cone = FreeCAD.ActiveDocument.addObject("Part::Cone", "myCone")
```

-   Where {{Incode|"myCone"}} is the name for the object.
-   The function returns the newly created object.

Example:


```python
import FreeCAD as App

doc = App.activeDocument()

cone = doc.addObject("Part::Cone", "myCone")
cone.Radius1 = 5
cone.Radius2 = 10
cone.Height = 50
cone.Angle = 270
cone.Placement = App.Placement(App.Vector(1, 2, 3), App.Rotation(30, 60, 15))

doc.recompute()
```
