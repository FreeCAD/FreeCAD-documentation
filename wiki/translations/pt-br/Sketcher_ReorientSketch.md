# Sketcher ReorientSketch/pt-br


</div>

## Description

Allows you to detach a sketch from a face and attach it to one of the main planes (with an offset).

## Usage

1.  Select the sketch to be re-oriented in the tree-view
2.  Choose **Sketch → [<img src=images/Sketcher_ReorientSketch.svg style="width:16px"> [Reorient sketch](Sketcher_ReorientSketch.md)** from the top menu.
3.  A menu will pop up and ask you if you want to detach the sketch from its face
4.  Selecting **Yes** will give you the same menu as in **Sketch → New Sketch**.
5.  You can attach the sketch to one of the main planes
6.  You also have the possibility to add a positive or negative offset

## Notes

-   When selecting **Cancel** in the second menu the sketch is simply detached from its face.
-   As long as no sketch is selected, the command is greyed out.
