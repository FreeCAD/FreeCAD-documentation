# Draft PathArray/pt-br



## Descrição

The <img alt="" src=images/Draft_PathArray.svg  style="width:24px;"> **Draft PathArray** command creates a regular array from a selected object by placing copies along a path. Use the [Draft PathLinkArray](Draft_PathLinkArray.md) command to create a more efficient [Link](App_Link.md) array instead. Except for the type of array that is created, Link array or regular array, the [Draft PathLinkArray](Draft_PathLinkArray.md) command is identical to this command.

Both commands can be used on 2D objects created with the [Draft Workbench](Draft_Workbench.md) or [Sketcher Workbench](Sketcher_Workbench.md), but also on many 3D objects such as those created with the [Part Workbench](Part_Workbench.md), [PartDesign Workbench](PartDesign_Workbench.md) or [Arch Workbench](Arch_Workbench.md).

*Draft PathArray*



## Utilização

1.  Select the object you wish to array.
2.  Add the path object to the selection. It is also possible to select edges instead. The edges must belong to the same object and they must be connected.
3.  There are several ways to invoke the command:
    -   Press the **<img src="images/Draft_PathArray.svg" width=16px> [Draft PathArray](Draft_PathArray.md)** button.
    -   Select the **Modification → Array tools → <img src="images/Draft_PathArray.svg" width=16px> Path array** option from the menu.
4.  The array is created.
5.  Optionally change the [properties](#Properties.md) of the array in the [Property editor](property_editor.md).

## Alignment

The alignment of the elements in a Draft PathArray depends on the properties of the array and the orientation of the source object. The position of the source object is ignored: for the purpose of the array the {{Value|x}}, {{Value|y}} and {{Value|z}} are set to {{Value|0}}. If the **Align** property of the array is set to `False` the orientation of the array elements is identical to that of the source object. If it is set to `True` the X axis of the local coordinate system of each element placement is tangent to the path. The Y and Z axes of the local coordinate systems depend on the **Align Mode** property of the array. Other array properties involved in the alignment include **Tangent Vector**, **Force Vertical** and **Vertical Vector**.

<img alt="" src=images/Draft_PathArray_example2.png  style="width:600px;"> 
*3 arrays based on the same non-planar path. From left to right: Align is false, Align is true with Align Mode Original and Align is true with Align Mode Frenet*.

### Align Mode 

Three modes are available:

#### Original

This mode comes closest to the single **Align Mode** available in version 0.18. It relies on a fixed normal vector. If the path is planar this vector is perpendicular to the plane of the path, else a default vector, the positive Z axis, is used. From this normal vector and the local tangent vector (the local X axis) a [cross product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product) is calculated. This new vector is used as the local Z axis. The orientation of the local Y axis is determined from the local X and Z axes.

#### Frenet

This mode uses the local normal vector derived from the path at each element placement. If this vector cannot be determined (for example in the case of a straight segment) a default vector, again the positive Z axis, is used instead. With this vector and the local tangent vector the local coordinate system is determined using the same procedure as in the previous paragraph.

#### Tangent

This mode is similar to **Align Mode** {{Value|Original}} but includes the possibility to pre-rotate the source object by specifying a **Tangent Vector**.

### Force Vertical and Vertical Vector 

These properties are only available if **Align Mode** is {{Value|Original}} or {{Value|Tangent}}. If **Force Vertical** is set to `True` the local coordinate system is calculated in a different manner. The **Vertical Vector** is used as a fixed normal vector. From this normal vector and the local tangent vector (the local X axis) again a cross product is calculated. But now this vector is used as the local Y axis. The orientation of the local Z axis is determined from the local X and Y axes.

Using these properties can be required if one of the edged of the path is (almost) parallel to the default normal of the path.



## Propriedades

See also: [Property editor](property_editor.md).

A Draft PathArray object is derived from a [Part Feature](Part_Feature.md) object and inherits all its properties (with the exception of some View properties that are not inherited by Link arrays). The following properties are additional unless otherwise stated:

## Scripting

See also: [Autogenerated API documentation](https://freecad.github.io/SourceDoc/) and [FreeCAD Scripting Basics](FreeCAD_Scripting_Basics.md).

To create a path array use the `make_path_array` method (<small>(v0.19)</small> ) of the Draft module. This method replaces the deprecated `makePathArray` method.


```python
path_array = make_path_array(base_object, path_object,
                             count=4, extra=App.Vector(0, 0, 0), subelements=None,
                             align=False, align_mode="Original", tan_vector=App.Vector(1, 0, 0),
                             force_vertical=False, vertical_vector=App.Vector(0, 0, 1),
                             use_link=True)
```

-    `base_object`is the object to be arrayed. It can also be the `Label` (string) of an object in the current document.

-    `path_object`is the path object. It can also be the `Label` (string) of an object in the current document.

-    `count`is the number of elements in the array.

-    `extra`is a vector that displaces each element.

-    `subelements`is a list of edges of `path_object`, for example `["Edge1", "Edge2"]`. If supplied only these edges are used for the path.

-   If `align` is `True` the elements are aligned along the path depending on the value of `align_mode`, which can be `"Original"`, `"Frenet"` or `"Tangent"`.

-    `tan_vector`is a unit vector that defines the local tangent direction of the elements along the path. It is used when `align_mode` is `"Tangent"`.

-   If `force_vertical` is `True` `vertical_vector` is used for the local Z direction of the elements along the path. It is used when `align_mode` is `"Original"` or `"Tangent"`.

-   If `use_link` is `True` the created elements are [App Links](App_Link.md) instead of regular copies.

-    `path_array`is returned with the created array object.

Example:


```python
import FreeCAD as App
import Draft

doc = App.newDocument()

p1 = App.Vector(500, -1000, 0)
p2 = App.Vector(1500, 1000, 0)
p3 = App.Vector(3000, 500, 0)
p4 = App.Vector(4500, 100, 0)
spline = Draft.make_bspline([p1, p2, p3, p4])
obj = Draft.make_polygon(3, 500)

path_array = Draft.make_path_array(obj, spline, 6)
doc.recompute()

wire = Draft.make_wire([p1, -p2, -p3, -p4])
path_array2 = Draft.make_path_array(obj, wire, count=3, extra=App.Vector(0, -500, 0), subelements=["Edge2", "Edge3"], align=True, force_vertical=True)
doc.recompute()
```
