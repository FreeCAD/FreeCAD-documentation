## Introdução

An [App Link](App_Link.md), or formally an `App   *   *Link`, is a type of object that references or links to another object, in the same document, or in another document. It is especially designed to efficiently duplicate a single object multiple times, which helps with the creation of complex [assemblies](assembly.md) from smaller subassemblies, and from multiple reusable components like screws, nuts, and similar fasteners.
