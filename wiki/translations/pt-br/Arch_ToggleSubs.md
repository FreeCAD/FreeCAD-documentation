# Arch ToggleSubs/pt-br



## Descrição

The **Arch ToggleSubs** tools toggles the visibility of all the subtractions of an [BIM](BIM_Workbench.md) object between visible and hidden.

Normally, if an Arch object, like an [Arch Wall](Arch_Wall.md), is selected and you press **Space** only the external wall will be hidden or made visible, but not the internal objects.

With this tool, the internal subtracted objects will all become visible or hidden.



## Utilização

1.  Select an Arch object that has subtractions.
2.  Select the **Utils → <img src="images/Arch_ToggleSubs.svg" width=16px> Toggle subcomponents** option from the menu.



## Opções

The color of a subtraction element can follow the style of [Draft construction](Draft_ToggleConstructionMode.md) elements, by activating the appropriate option in the [Arch Preferences](Arch_Preferences.md), in the menu **Edit → Preferences → Arch → General settings → Apply Draft construction style to subcomponents**.

The [Draft construction](Draft_ToggleConstructionMode.md) style can be set in the [Draft Preferences](Draft_Preferences.md), in the menu **Preferences → Draft → General Draft**.
