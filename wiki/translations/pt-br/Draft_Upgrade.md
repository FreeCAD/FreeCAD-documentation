# Draft Upgrade/pt-br

## Descrição

The <img alt="" src=images/Draft_Upgrade.svg  style="width:24px;"> **Draft Upgrade** command upgrades selected objects. The result depends on the number of selected objects and their type. The command can for example fuse elements and create faces. It is worth trying to upgrade a selection several times to see if a better result can be obtained. See the example in the image. Note that not all objects can be upgraded. This command is the counterpart of the [Draft Downgrade](Draft_Downgrade.md) command.

<img alt="" src=images/Draft_Upgrade_example.jpg  style="width:400px;"> 
*An open non-editable wire is upgraded to a closed wire, and then to a face. A closed non-editable square wire is also upgraded to a face. The two faces are then upgraded to create a compound, which is finally upgraded to a single editable Draft Wire.*

## Utilização

1.  Optionally select one or more objects.
2.  There are several ways to invoke the command:
    -   Press the **<img src="images/Draft_Upgrade.svg" width=16px> [Draft Upgrade](Draft_Upgrade.md)** button.
    -   Select the **Modification → <img src="images/Draft_Upgrade.svg" width=16px> Upgrade** option from the menu.
    -   Use the keyboard shortcut: **U** then **P**.
3.  If you have not yet selected an object: select an object in the [3D view](3D_view.md).

## Notas

-   [Draft Lines](Draft_Line.md) and [Draft Wires](Draft_Wire.md) can be joined with this command, but also with the [Draft Join](Draft_Join.md) command or the [Draft Wire](Draft_Wire.md) command.

## Scripting

See also: [Autogenerated API documentation](https://freecad.github.io/SourceDoc/) and [FreeCAD Scripting Basics](FreeCAD_Scripting_Basics.md).

To upgrade objects use the `upgrade` method of the Draft module.


```python
upgrade_list = upgrade(objects, delete=False, force=None)
```

-    `objects`contains the objects to be upgraded. It is either a single object or a list of objects.

-   If `delete` is `True` the source objects are deleted.

-    `force`forces a certain way of upgrading by calling a specific internal function. It can be: `"makeCompound"`, `"closeGroupWires"`, `"makeSolid"`, `"closeWire"`, `"turnToParts"`, `"makeFusion"`, `"makeShell"`, `"makeFaces"`, `"draftify"`, `"joinFaces"`, `"makeSketchFace"`, `"makeWires"` or `"turnToLine"`.

-    `upgrade_list`is returned. It is a list containing two lists: a list of new objects and a list of objects to be deleted. If `delete` is `True` the second list is empty.

Example:


```python
import FreeCAD as App
import Draft

doc = App.newDocument()

circle = Draft.make_circle(1000)
rectangle = Draft.make_rectangle(2000, 800)
doc.recompute()

add_list1, delete_list1 = Draft.upgrade([circle, rectangle], delete=False)

line1 = Draft.make_line(App.Vector(2000, 0, 0), App.Vector(2500, 1500, 0))
line2 = Draft.make_line(App.Vector(2500, 1500, 0), App.Vector(3000, -1000, 0))
doc.recompute()

add_list2, delete_list2 = Draft.upgrade([line1, line2], delete=False)

simple_wire = add_list2[0]
add_list3, delete_list3 = Draft.upgrade(simple_wire, delete=False)

closed_wire = add_list3[0]
add_list4, delete_list4 = Draft.upgrade(closed_wire, delete=False)

face = add_list4[0]
add_list5, delete_list5 = Draft.upgrade(face, delete=False)

doc.recompute()
```
