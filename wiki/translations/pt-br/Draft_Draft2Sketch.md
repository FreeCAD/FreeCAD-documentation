# Draft Draft2Sketch/pt-br



## Descrição

The <img alt="" src=images/Draft_Draft2Sketch.svg  style="width:24px;"> **Draft Draft2Sketch** command converts [Draft](Draft_Workbench.md) objects to [Sketcher Sketches](Sketcher_NewSketch.md) and vice versa.

*Converting Draft objects to Sketcher Sketches*



## Utilização

1.  Optionally select one or more Draft objects or [Sketcher Sketches](Sketcher_NewSketch.md).
2.  There are several ways to invoke the command:
    -   Press the **<img src="images/Draft_Draft2Sketch.svg" width=16px> [Draft Draft2Sketch](Draft_Draft2Sketch.md)** button.
    -   Select the **Modification → <img src="images/Draft_Draft2Sketch.svg" width=16px> Draft to Sketch** option from the menu.
3.  If you have not yet selected an object: select an object in the [3D view](3D_view.md).
4.  A new object is created.



## Notas

-   Non-Draft objects that are totally planar can also be converted.
-   The command can only handle objects made up out of straight lines, circular arcs, elliptical arcs, B-Splines and Bézier curves.
-   [Draft BezCurves](Draft_BezCurve.md) will be approximated by [Sketcher BSplines](Sketcher_CreateBSpline.md).
-   The external [KicadStepUp Workbench](KicadStepUp_Workbench.md) contains a command to convert a [Draft BSpline](Draft_BSpline.md) into a series of [Sketcher Arcs](Sketcher_CreateArc.md). For more information see the forum topic [BSplines to Shape2DView and Sketcher](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=25082).
-   [This other forum topic](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=58781#p505207) contains a macro for such a conversion.

## Scripting

See also: [Autogenerated API documentation](https://freecad.github.io/SourceDoc/) and [FreeCAD Scripting Basics](FreeCAD_Scripting_Basics.md).

To convert objects to a sketch use the `make_sketch` method (<small>(v0.19)</small> ) of the Draft module. This method replaces the deprecated `makeSketch` method.


```python
sketch = make_sketch(objects_list, autoconstraints=False, addTo=None, delete=False, name="Sketch", radiusPrecision=-1, tol=1e-3)
```

-    `objects_list`contains the objects to be converted. It is either a single object or a list of objects. `Draft` objects, `Part::Feature` objects and `Part.Shape` objects are supported.

-   If `autoconstraints` is `True` coincident constraints are added to nodes belonging to the same source object.

-    `addTo`is the existing sketch object the geometry is added to. If not supplied a new sketch is created.

-   If `delete` is `True` the source objects are deleted.

-    `name`is the name for the new sketch.

-    `radiusPrecision`indicates how radius constraints should be handled:

    -   Use `-1` to disable radius constraints.
    -   Use `0` to add individual radius constraints.
    -   Use a positive number to round radii according to this precision, and to add equal constraints between curves with equal radii.

-    `tol`is the tolerance used to check if shapes are planar and co-planar. Use `-1` for a strict analysis.

-    `sketch`is returned with the sketch object.

To convert a sketch to Draft objects use the `draftify` method of the Draft module.


```python
draftify(objectslist, makeblock=False, delete=True)
```

-    `objectslist`contains the objects to be converted. It is either a single object or a list of objects.

-   If `makeblock` is `True` the converted objects are grouped in a `Part::Part2DObject`.

-   If `delete` is `True` the source objects are deleted.

Example:


```python
import FreeCAD as App
import Draft

doc = App.newDocument()

rectangle = Draft.make_rectangle(2000, 1000)
circle = Draft.make_circle(500)
doc.recompute()

sketch_from_draft = Draft.make_sketch([rectangle, circle], autoconstraints=True, delete=False, radiusPrecision=0)
doc.recompute()

draft_from_sketch = Draft.draftify(sketch_from_draft, delete=False)
doc.recompute()
```
