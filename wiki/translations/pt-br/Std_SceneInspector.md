# Std SceneInspector/pt-br

## Description

The **Std SceneInspector** command opens a dialog box displaying an overview of all nodes in the [scenegraph](Scenegraph.md) of the active [3D view](3D_view.md). It is more a utility for programmers than for average users. It can be used to find out why the rendering is slow or why something isn\'t rendered properly.

## Usage

1.  Select the **Tools → <img src="images/Std_SceneInspector.svg" width=16px> Scene inspector...** option from the menu.
2.  The **Scene Inspector** dialog box opens.
3.  The dialog box is modeless, meaning it can stay open while you continue working in FreeCAD.
4.  Optionally press the **Refresh** to update the overview.
5.  Press the **Close** button to close the dialog box.
