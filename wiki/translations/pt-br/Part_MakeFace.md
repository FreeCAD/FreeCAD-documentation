# Part MakeFace/pt-br

## Description

Part MakeFace‏‎ creates a [plane](Part_Plane.md) in a custom shape. The shape is defined by a closed sketch contour.

It is possible to nest closed contours, for example to have circles inside a polygon. In this case the face will be created between the contours like in this example   *
