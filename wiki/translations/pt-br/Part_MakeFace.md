# Part MakeFace/pt-br

## Description

**Part MakeFace**‏‎ creates a [plane](Part_Plane.md) in a custom shape. The shape is defined by a closed sketch contour.

It is possible to nest closed contours, for example to have circles inside a polygon. In this case the face will be created between the contours like in this example:

<img alt="" src=images/Part_MakeFace-example.png  style="width:300px;">



*Example of a face created from a nested set of contours.*

## Usage

1.  Select a sketch defining at least one closed contour
2.  Press the **<img src="images/Part_MakeFace.svg" width=16px> [Make face from wires](Part_MakeFace.md)** button
