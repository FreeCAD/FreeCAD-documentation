# Interface creation/pt-br
## Introduction

Power users have the possibility of [creating interfaces](Interface_creation.md) to help them produce complex tools for their custom [addons](Addon.md), such as [macros](Macros.md) or full [workbenches](Workbenches.md).

Interfaces are created using [PySide](PySide.md), which is a library for using Qt with [Python](Python.md).

*Two general methods to create interfaces, by including the interface in the Python file, or by using `.ui* files.`

## Description

There are typically two ways of creating interfaces with PySide.

### Interface in a .ui file 

In this method the interface is defined in a `.ui` file (an XML document that defines the structure of the interface), which is then imported into [Python](Python.md) code that uses it. This is the recommended approach.

-   It allows the programmer to work with the graphical interface separately from the logic that will use it.
-   It allows anybody to look at the interface alone, that is, the `.ui` file, without having to run Python code.
-   The `.ui` file may be designed by anybody without programming knowledge.
-   The `.ui` interface can be used in a standalone window (modal), or in an embedded window (non-modal); therefore, this method is ideal to create custom [task panels](Task_panel.md).
-   Since the `.ui` file just describes the \"appearance\" of the interface, it does not need to be tied to a particular programming language; it may be used both in [Python](Python.md) and C++ code.

### Interface completely in Python code 

In this method the entire interface is defined by several Python calls.

-   This is an older way of working with interfaces.
-   This method produces very verbose code because many details of the interface need to be specified by hand.
-   It is not simple to separate the interface from the logic that uses that code, meaning that a user would need to run the [Python](Python.md) file in the correct context in order to see how the interface would look.
-   This method has the advantage that several interfaces may be contained within a single document, at the expense of making the file very large.
-   This method is recommended only for small interfaces that don\'t define more than a few widgets, for example in [macros](Macros.md).

For examples on this method see [Interface creation completely in Python](Dialog_creation.md).
