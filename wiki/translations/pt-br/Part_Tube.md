# Part Tube/pt-br

## Description

The <img alt="" src=images/Part_Tube.svg  style="width:24px;"> **Part Tube** command creates a parametric tube solid. In the coordinate system defined by its **Placement** property, the bottom face of the tube lies on the XY plane with its center at the origin.

## Usage

### Create

1.  There are several ways to invoke the command:
    -   Press the **<img src="images/Part_Tube.svg" width=16px> [Part Tube](Part_Tube.md)** button.
    -   Select the **Part → Primitives → <img src="images/Part_Tube.svg" width=16px> Create tube** option from the menu.
2.  The **Tube** task panel opens and a preview of the tube is displayed in the [3D view](3D_view.md).
3.  Specify the dimensions.
4.  The preview is dynamically updated.
5.  Press the **OK** button.
6.  The tube is created.
7.  Optionally change the **Placement** of the tube in the [Property editor](Property_editor.md), or with the <img alt="" src=images/Std_TransformManip.svg  style="width:16px;"> [Std TransformManip](Std_TransformManip.md) command.

### Edit

1.  Double-click the tube in the [Tree view](Tree_view.md)
2.  The **Tube** task panel opens.
3.  Change one or more dimensions.
4.  The tube is dynamically updated in the [3D view](3D_view.md).
5.  Press the **OK** button.

## Example

![Part Tube from the scripting example](images/Part_Tube_Scripting_Example.png )

A Part Tube object created with the [scripting example](#Scripting.md) below is shown here.

## Properties

See also: [Property editor](Property_editor.md).

A Part Tube object is derived from a [Part Feature](Part_Feature.md) object and inherits all its properties. It also has the following additional properties:

### Data


{{TitleProperty|Attachment}}

The object has the same attachment properties as a [Part Part2DObject](Part_Part2DObject#Data.md).


{{TitleProperty|Tube}}

-    **Height|Length**: The height of the tube. The default is {{Value|10mm}}.

-    **Inner Radius|Length**: The inner radius of the tube. Must be smaller than **Outer Radius**. Can be {{Value|0}}. The default is {{Value|2mm}}.

-    **Outer Radius|Length**: The outer radius of the tube. Must be larger than **Inner Radius**. The default is {{Value|5mm}}.

## Scripting

See also: [Autogenerated API documentation](https://freecad.github.io/SourceDoc/), [Part scripting](Part_scripting.md) and [FreeCAD Scripting Basics](FreeCAD_Scripting_Basics.md).

A Part Tube can be created with the {{Incode|addTube()}} method (<small>(v0.20)</small> ) of the Shapes module:


```python
tube = Shapes.addTube(FreeCAD.ActiveDocument, "myTube")
```

-   Where {{Incode|"myTube"}} is the name for the object.
-   The function returns the newly created object.

Example:


```python
import FreeCAD as App
from BasicShapes import Shapes

doc = App.activeDocument()

tube = Shapes.addTube(FreeCAD.ActiveDocument, "myTube")
tube.Height = 20
tube.InnerRadius = 2
tube.OuterRadius = 3
tube.Placement = App.Placement(App.Vector(2, 4, 5), App.Rotation(60, 60, 30))

doc.recompute()
```
