## Multithreading in FreeCAD 

-   Some 3rd party libraries do some multi-threading like the CAD kernel OCC for boolean operations or the tessellation to create a display mesh from the model.
-   The Eigen3 library which is heavily used for the Sketcher also supports multi-threading. ([source](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=37327&p=317539#p317535))
