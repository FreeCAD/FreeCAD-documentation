## General

With more than 8128 commits in the master branch since the 0.18 release, this is one of the most extensive releases ever, with several new components like the new \"[App::Link](App_Link.md)\" object, as well as many new tools in the [TechDraw Workbench](TechDraw_Workbench.md) that make FreeCAD even more powerful for 3D solid modelling and assembly. Beside that, the FreeCAD ecosystem has continued to grow with more specialized [external workbenches](external_workbenches.md).

### Python 3 and Qt5 

The effort to migrate from Python 2 and Qt4 to Python 3 and Qt5 is essentially complete and most developers have moved to the Python3/Qt5 toolchains.

Undoubtedly there are unforeseen bugs; these will be addressed as they are reported. Any existing dependence on Python 2 or Qt4 will not be supported beyond 1st January 2020 when Python 2 officially became unsupported by the Python Foundation. Please note that certain addons have not been ported yet to Python3/Qt5. This may be due to several reasons including lack of time by their developers, or broken dependencies that may not be easily fixed, or simply because the addon is considered obsolete. Individuals interested in the migration of a particular workbench or tool are encouraged to participate in the [FreeCAD forum](https://forum.freecadweb.org/); see also, [Python3 and Qt5 Compatible Addon Workbenches (in preparation for 0.18)](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=30624).

### Some issues 

Fixed issue with [Std Part](Std_Part.md) containers visibility when the viewport is displayed in full screen in Qt5:

-   Set `Qt::AA_ShareOpenGLContexts` for Qt 5.9 and above; [forum discussion](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=36744#p312444), [commit 2a1dd8415](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/commit/2a1dd8415), and [commit 57b3ca6f77](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/commit/57b3ca6f77c3bc3a7fdb802f2e8a9fcf466f5e3a).
-   Disabled **ESC** button support in `View3DInventor::keyEvent()` for Qt5 to avoid MDI view mode-related rendering artifacts; [forum discussion](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=36744#p312444), [commit 960d612547](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/commit/960d6125473ee27f37835145348be382436dd274).
-   Fixed bug in `MainWindow::setActiveWindow` to avoid a crash when returning from full screen; [forum discussion](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?p=326093#p326093), [commit c4e34ed9b](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/commit/c4e34ed9b).
-   Fixed [issue #4088](https://freecadweb.org/tracker/view.php?id=4088) about the visibility of the origin of a Part changing when undocking the 3D view; [forum discussion](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?p=326093#p326093), [commit 1e19ef5be](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/commit/1e19ef5be).
-   Fixed [issue #3130](https://freecadweb.org/tracker/view.php?id=0003130) about Qt5 bugs when using a high resolution external monitor; [forum discussion](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=34916), [commit 2f2d505359](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/commit/2f2d5053599785fdc8db481682746066911033b4).

### Development

To [compile FreeCAD under Windows](Compile_on_Windows.md), there are different Libpacks (prepackaged libraries) available:

-   Libpack for Windows with Qt 5.12, OCC 7.3, and Python 3.6; [forum discussion](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=35789).
-   Libpack for Windows with Qt 5.12.6, OCC 7.4; [forum discussion](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=42945), [pull request #2944](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/2944).
-   [Libpack 12.5.1](https://github.com/apeltauer/FreeCAD/releases/tag/LibPack_12.5.1) for Windows with Qt 5.15, OCC 7.5, and Python 3.8; [forum discussion](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=55077&start=150#p482128)

Other development news:

-   There is a new Docker container to build FreeCAD, see [Compile on Docker](Compile_on_Docker.md); [forum discussion](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=42954).
-   The infrastructure of the bug tracker as well as wiki was moved to a dedicated server, so that it is easier to manage by the project administrators; [forum discussion](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=42795).

### Documentation

-   The [Compile on Linux](Compile_on_Linux.md) page was reviewed to better explain the requisites to compile on different Linux distributions. As many developers use Debian based systems, this section received the most attention. Users of other Linux distributions are encouraged to maintain the documentation for their particular distribution.
-   [Compile on Windows](Compile_on_Windows.md) was also rewritten to explain how to use the \"LibPack\" for compilation.
-   [Compile on Docker](Compile_on_Docker.md) was created to describe the compilation in this system.
-   The [Source documentation](Source_documentation.md) page also received a clean-up to better explain how to produce the programming (API) documentation from C++ and Python sources.
-   The [Doxygen](Doxygen.md) page was reviewed and extended to give more details about the syntax that is used in C++ files to produce the programming documentation.
-   The [Source code management](Source_code_management.md) page was also reworked with better descriptions and examples of using `git` to manage branches and contribute code.
-   The [External workbenches](External_workbenches.md) page was re-organized, so that all feature-rich, publicly available workbenches are listed. If you\'d like to add a workbench to this page, showcase it in the forum, and provide supporting information like user manual, wiki pages, and a link to its repository. Then push for it to be included in the [Addon Manager](Std_AddonMgr.md).
-   There have been improvements to the [Tutorials](Tutorials.md) and [Video tutorials](Video_tutorials.md) pages. In particular, it has been stressed to readers that they should consider only video tutorials that are made with versions 0.17 and above.

### Known Limitations 

-   Black screen due to video card drivers, while running FreeCAD inside a virtual machine; [issue #3939](https://freecadweb.org/tracker/view.php?id=3939).
-   Logitech Wingman USB joystick can cause erratic behavior when spinning and zooming in the view; [forum discussion](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=36712&start=10).
-   Gesture navigation is fully supported for Windows but yet to be maintained in Linux and MacOS. Problem: the developer, DeepSOIC, doesn\'t have a MacOS machine with its special trackpad, and hasn\'t tested it on Linux either; [forum discussion](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?p=308403#p308402).

## App::Link and assembly 

<img alt="" src=images/Link.svg  style="width:64px;"> <img alt="" src=images/AppLink.png  style="width:500px;"> 
*The "App::Link" object allows lightweight linking of objects in a document and from external documents.*

After 2.5 years in development, the \"[Link](App_Link.md)\" object, or more formally [App Link](App_Link.md) (`App::Link` class), was introduced in FreeCAD. This is a special type of [App DocumentObject](App_DocumentObject.md) with certain properties that will hopefully allow for doing assemblies easier.

An \"[App Link](App_Link.md)\" allows objects to use another object\'s data, such as geometry or even their 3D visual representation, in the same or different files. It can be thought of as a thin, absolute clone, or as the same object living into two different \"instances\". Some functionality offered by an \"App Link\" is already present in some workbenches like [Arch](Arch_Workbench.md) and [BIM](BIM_Workbench.md) ([clones](Draft_Clone.md), [external references](Arch_Reference.md)), but the \"App Link\" implementation is at the core level, and thus can be used by all workbenches in different ways.

The \"[App Link](App_Link.md)\" component was thought and developed almost single-handedly by user {{emphasis|realthunder}}. The motivations and design implementations behind this project are described in his GitHub page, [Link](https://github.com/realthunder/FreeCAD_assembly3/wiki/Link). In order to accomplish this feature, several core changes to FreeCAD were made; these are also extensively documented in [Core-Changes](https://github.com/realthunder/FreeCAD_assembly3/wiki/Core-Changes).

The history of \"App Link\" can be traced to some essential forum threads:

-   [Why an object can only be inside one App::Part?](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=21505) (March 2017)

-   [Merging of my Link branch](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=29542) (June 2018)

Finally, the pull request and merge happened:

-   [App::Link: the big merge](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=27&t=38621), old thread (July 2019), [pull request #2350](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/2350) (the BIG merge), [LinkMerge branch](https://github.com/realthunder/FreeCAD/tree/LinkMerge).
-   [App::Link: the big merge](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=37757), main thread (July 2019)
-   [A simple path description of Link, 019, Link stage, Asm3, merge?](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?p=329054#p329054) (August 2019)
-   [PR#2559: expose link and navigation actions](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=39672), an introduction to the Link feature in 0.19 (September 2019).

The \"App Link\" object prepares FreeCAD for the phase that was scheduled to happen after the redesign of [PartDesign in FreeCAD 0.17](Release_notes_0.17.md), which is working with assemblies.

[Assembly3](Assembly3_Workbench.md) is an assembly workbench written in Python by realthunder, that makes use of the \"App Link\" functionality. The workbench served as a testbed for this component during its development. While Assembly3 is still not officially part of FreeCAD, with the inclusion of \"App Link\" in the master branch, it is a matter of time for Assembly3 to be provided as an installable add-on, just like [A2plus](A2plus_Workbench.md) and [Assembly4](Assembly4_Workbench.md) are provided currently.

## Core system, App, Base, and Gui namespaces 

Beside the introduction of [App Link](App_Link.md), the \"LinkMerge\" branch also introduced some changes visible to the user with regards to object properties, [expressions](Expressions.md), [visual selection](Selection_methods.md), and the [tree view](tree_view.md). These are described in the [Core-Changes](https://github.com/realthunder/FreeCAD_assembly3/wiki/Core-Changes) page.

| <img alt="" src=images/FreeCAD_Arch_Coin_rendering.png  style="width:384px;">           | New rendering modes for [Arch SectionPlane](Arch_SectionPlane.md) that can be selected when using [TechDraw ArchView](TechDraw_ArchView.md), **Render Mode**, {{Value|Coin}} and {{Value|Coin mono}}. The section plane generates an SVG that is simply displayed in a TechDraw page; with these new modes, the SVG generation is performed by Coin, so it is faster than using {{Value|Wireframe}} and {{Value|Solid}}, which use the internal OCCT kernel to calculate the SVG projection. The tradeoff is between speed and precision; the Coin modes are faster but less precise, while the original modes are more precise but relatively slow. |

This results in more memory efficient arrays. This is possible with the new [Draft LinkArray](Draft_LinkArray.md) and [Draft PathLinkArray](Draft_PathLinkArray.md) tools. [Draft LinkArray](Draft_LinkArray.md) works in three modes, \"ortho\", \"polar\", and the new \"circular\" mode, which was introduced in a separate commit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

This [Draft OrthoArray](Draft_OrthoArray.md) is used to create exclusively orthogonal arrays. It shows a task panel similar to [Draft PolarArray](Draft_PolarArray.md) and [Draft CircularArray](Draft_CircularArray.md). Therefore, from the toolbar it is now possible to create \"orthogonal\", \"polar\" and \"circular\" arrays from separate buttons. Moreover, the array buttons are collected in a group so that they are organized.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

This makes it easier to recognize objects which are lines, curves, geometrical elements, linear, radial, or angular dimensions, or other objects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

We invite enthusiastic developers to join the effort.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| <img alt="" src=images/Draft_AnnotationStyleEditor_example_relnotes_0.19.png  style="width:384px;"> | New [Annotation style editor](Draft_AnnotationStyleEditor.md) tool to create styles for annotations. These styles can define things like text font, size, color, and arrows, which can be applied to any of your texts, dimensions or labels. We started by implementing an editor and a system to store the styles in the document. Next steps will be adapting the different annotation objects to support the styles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

### Further Draft Improvements 

-   The [Draft Wire](Draft_Wire.md) tool now is called \"Polyline\" in the menu, instead of \"DWire\"; all options and functionality remain the same, so this doesn\'t break compatibility; [commit 39e748229e](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/commit/39e748229e67fa93e924e355c0ce0897c870d756).

-   A \"DraftEditPickRadius\" preference was added to control the area of influence of the pointer when picking vertices in edit mode [Draft Edit](Draft_Edit.md); [forum discussion](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=40060), [pull request #2642](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/2642), [issue #4162](https://freecadweb.org/tracker/view.php?id=4162).

-   Undergoing efforts to document the Python source code (adding complete docstrings), in order to produce better programming documentation that can be used by both users and developers. See [Source documentation](Source_documentation.md) for instructions on generating the documentation with [Doxygen](Doxygen.md).

-   The \"Toolbar mode\" when launching the Draft tools has been removed. This was an interface that was used in the past but became obsolete as the [task panel](task_panel.md) became the predominant interface; [forum discussion](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=34&t=42782), [pull request #2973](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/2973).

-    `Draft.copy`now works with any document object, thanks to the new `Document.copyObject()` method introduced with the LinkMerge; pull request [#3658](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/3658).

## FEM Workbench 

+++
| <img alt="" src=images/Femconcrete_Wall_3D_rx_PSS.png  style="width:384px;">               | After half a year in development and testing the \"femconcrete\" branch was added to the FEM Workbench. This provides tools to estimate the level of reinforcement required in a concrete structure to prevent brittle failure under tension or shear. In essence, it is a post processing routine for the CalculiX solver, which calculates the principal tensile stresses in the concrete from an elastic analysis and uses those to determine the minimum reinforcement in the three coordinate directions required to prevent failure.

| <img alt="" src=images/fcFEM_Plate_with_Hole_2.png  style="width:384px;">                     | After a few months in development the \"fcFEM\" macro was published. It implements a finite element solver entirely in Python. Its author designed it to overcome the limitations of other external solvers, like CalculiX and z88. Some of the intended improvements include creating mixed mesh analyses, improved beam and shell elements, arc-length control for overcoming limit points in elastic-plastic analyses, implementation of zero-thickness interface elements for different applications, and others.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| <img alt="" src=images/FEM_Beso_topology_optimization.png  style="width:384px;">       | Topology optimization has long been a feature desired for those working with FEM. In 2016 the BESO (Bi-directional Evolutionary Structural Optimization) project was started, implementing an iterative method with the CalculiX solver that removes ineffective elements from a mesh in order to optimize the mass of the design. In the 0.19 development cycle, a simple graphical interface has been developed to facilitate generating the beso configuration files.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

### Further FEM Improvements 

-   The Elmer project has developed a library for handling batch type pre-processing for the ElmerSolver, using the FEM Workbench. This includes creating mesh objects for FreeCAD, manipulating the mesh sizes of solids, creating finite element meshes using Gmsh, running ElmerGrid and exporting the mesh for ElmerSolver, and selecting and naming bodies and boundaries for ElmerSolver; [forum discussion](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=38950), [elmerfem](https://github.com/ElmerCSC/elmerfem) repository (Elmer main repository), [FreeCADBatchFEMTools](https://github.com/ElmerCSC/elmerfem/tree/devel/ElmerWorkflows/FreeCADBatchFEMTools) repository (library to interact with FEM Workbench, LGPL 2.1).
-   The integration of the OOFem solver, which started in 2018, is progressing, so it is now another option that can be used for structural analysis in FreeCAD. This solver is interesting in that it has interface elements, as well as arc-length control, in addition to many non-linear material models. The integration of OOFEM into FEM has been carried in various commits that together serve as documentation on how to integrate similar solvers; [forum discussion](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=31288), [femoofem](https://github.com/berndhahnebach/FreeCAD_bhb/tree/femoofem) branch, [OOFEM](http://www.oofem.org/) main website, [oofem](https://github.com/oofem/oofem) repository (LGPL 2.1).
-   Updated coding standards that strive for PEP8 compliance with Python; [forum discussion](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=12833), [commit ad03ee9bdf](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/commit/ad03ee9bdfeeb23d5c79cf462ba4a5b5566c5bc1), [commit 27cb54009b](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/commit/27cb54009b57c1938f7ff97026c8b35c1688233f).

## Import

-   Improved import/export compatibility with proprietary CAD systems, when using compressed STEP, or STPZ; [forum discussion](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=37469), [pull request #2323](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/2323), [commit 7de89cf62e](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/commit/7de89cf62e0411dcd).

| <img alt="" src=images/Mesh_FromPartShape_Gmsh.png  style="width:384px;"> | [Mesh FromPartShape](Mesh_FromPartShape.md) is now able to create [meshes](mesh.md) using [Gmsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gmsh). This mesher is an external program that must be installed in the system before it can be used. Gmsh was already one of the options to create [finite element meshes](FEM_Mesh.md) with the [FEM Workbench](FEM_Workbench.md). |

### Further improvements 

-   It is now possible to take an OpenInventor mesh file (**.iv**), and export it to STL; [forum discussion](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=43926#p378032), [commit 601ac707b2](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/commit/601ac707b2).
-   It is now possible to export a [Mesh](Mesh.md) to [Asymptote format](Asymptote.md) (**.asy** ); [forum thread](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=48915), [commits 4badaba5](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/commit/4badaba5), [50bbd522](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/commit/50bbd522), [58a92681](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/commit/58a92681), [dd7afa72](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/commit/dd7afa72), [b0f78f5a](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/commit/b0f78f5a).
-   Most tools of the [Mesh Workbench](Mesh_Workbench.md) now have a proper icon so it is easier to recognize the function in the menu and toolbars; [forum thread](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=34&t=47494), pull request [#3816](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/3816), [#3864](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/3864).

### Further improvements 

-   The dialog to edit [Prisms](Part_Prism.md) allows now to specify an angle in respect to the normal of the chosen attachment plane. This way one can create skew prisms. [Forum discussion](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=27&t=49343#p422857), [pull request #3793](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/3793)
-   New Face method: `Part.Face.cutHoles(list_of_wires)` to cut holes into a face. The face usually needs to be validated after operation.
-   The [App Link](App_Link.md) merge introduced two new commands, [Part TransformedCopy](Part_TransformedCopy.md) and [Part ElementCopy](Part_ElementCopy.md). These commands create non-parametric copies of a body with a transformed placement, and of an element (vertex, edge, or face); [commit 6da72b9859](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/commit/6da72b9859f6d21119831d44a8d132c8e2dfb544). These operations essentially make the [Macro Repro Wire](Macro_Repro_Wire.md) obsolete.
-   It is now possible to set [expressions](Expressions.md) for all parameters of [primitives](Part_Workbench#Primitives.md). [commit dd4874d2](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/commit/dd4874d2) and [commit 7405dd0e](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/commit/7405dd0e).

### Further improvements 

-   The [hole dialog](PartDesign_Hole.md) has been overhauled to create norm-conform clearance and threaded hole dimensions.
-   It is now possible to set [expressions](Expressions.md) for all parameters of [additive](PartDesign_CompPrimitiveAdditive.md) and [subtractive primitives](PartDesign_CompPrimitiveSubtractive.md). [Forum discussion](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=36458), [pull request #3225](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/3225).
-   It is now possible to set [expressions](Expressions.md) for the attachment angles of additive and subtractive primitives. Formerly, expressions were only available for the direction offsets. [Forum discussion](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=44346), [commit 1cfe6d2cc7](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/commit/1cfe6d2cc7).
-   It is now possible to change the list items in the different dialogs. For example [in this forum post](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=27&t=48998#p420352) there is a good example why the item list matters for transformations. [Here](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=50222#p430499) is another example for the sketch order for lofts.

## Render Workbench 

Added support for Blender\'s standalone \"Cycles\" renderer; [commit 759067912f](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-render/commit/759067912f0640e4b3dac41b104d2372978f94a1); [FreeCAD-render](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-render) repository. The Cycles standalone renderer usually needs to be compiled from source, as the binary is normally not provided by itself in a complete Blender distribution.

Besides this, the Render Workbench already has support for Pov-Ray, Luxrender and Appleseed.

-   It is now possible to [ decrease the knot multiplicity](Sketcher_BSplineDecreaseDegree.md) of B-Splines. [commit fc89f4eb0](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/commit/fc89f4eb0).
-   The [ fillet](Sketcher_CreateFillet.md) tool preserves now all possible existing constraints of the touched lines. [pull request #4296](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/4296), [forum discussion](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=54179)
-   New method to get the geometrical index of a [sketch](Sketcher_SketchObject.md), `SketchObject.getGeoVertexIndex(index)`; [forum discussion](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=48707), [pull request #3713](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/3713).

## Spreadsheet Workbench 

The introduction of [App Link](App_Link.md) also brought some improvements to the [expressions](expressions.md) capabilities of FreeCAD, which are visible in the [property editor](property_editor.md), and the [Spreadsheet Workbench](Spreadsheet_Workbench.md). These are described in [Core-Changes](https://github.com/realthunder/FreeCAD_assembly3/wiki/Core-Changes) and this [forum thread](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=27&t=38974).

-   A new expression syntax is introduced to unambiguously reference a property of the owner object, by omitting the object reference and starting with a leading dot (`.`), similar to Python relative import syntax. So instead of `Cylinder.Height`, now you can use `.Height`.
-   You can refer to an object by its `Name` or by its `Label`. In the case of a `Label`, it must be enclosed in `<<` and `>>` symbols, such as `<<Label>>`. For example, `<<Metal_cylinder>>.Height`.
-   Improved spreadsheet recomputation logic, and cell copy and paste functions. [Pull request #2350](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/2350), [#2475](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/2475).

The previous commits changed the way the autocompletion works with [expressions](expressions.md), particularly when used with [Sketcher](Sketcher_Workbench.md) constraints, which was seen as a regression for many use cases. A new set of commits were proposed to restore this functionality; [forum discussion](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=43412), [pull request #3062](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/3062).

It produces a static image from the active 3D view, and puts it in a new TechDraw view. The result is a snapshot that doesn\'t update with changes to the model, and which is very fast to produce because it doesn\'t perform hidden line removal calculations. It is intended for rapid visualization of models, or to display flat projections of models without needing to add dimensions, a workflow that may be interesting for architectural visualization. Together with [Arch SectionPlane](Arch_SectionPlane.md) and [TechDraw ArchView](TechDraw_ArchView.md), [TechDraw ActiveView](TechDraw_ActiveView.md) hopes to improve the interaction between [Arch](Arch_Workbench.md) and [TechDraw](TechDraw_Workbench.md) to document building models.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

### Further TechDraw Improvements 

-   There has been discussions about changing the standard behavior of TechDraw. Instead of keeping the drawing pages updated automatically, they would be updated only on demand; this would mitigate the effects of TechDraw slowing down the rest of FreeCAD when modelling. Moreover, now that [App Link](App_Link.md) is included in FreeCAD, TechDraw pages may be stored in a separate file, and loaded on demand; [forum discussion](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=35086) (main discussion), [forum discussion](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=38822) (alternatives).
-   Improvements on the handling of sectional views with [TechDraw SectionView](TechDraw_SectionView.md); [Forum discussion](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=40639), [pull request #2737](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/2737).
-   Fixed font size issues when exporting to SVG; [forum discussion](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=27108), [pull request #2219](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/2219).
-   Fixed regression in caption handling and hide caption property where not applicable; [pull request #2228](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/2228).
-   Added options for page size, line width and background when saving to SVG; this improves Draft/Arch and TechDraw integration; [pull request #2455](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/2455).
-   New panning of the page using the middle mouse button; [forum discussion](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=29679#p327695), [pull request #2458](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/2458).
-   Finer control of drawing updates; [forum discussion](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=38956), [pull request #2468](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/2468), [commit 5bed53f858](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/commit/5bed53f858), [commit b2d8eeeb65](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/commit/b2d8eeeb65).
-   Also new [TechDraw RedrawPage](TechDraw_RedrawPage.md) tool to force a drawing page update while ignoring the state of the options \"Update with 3d\", \"Allow page override\", or \"KeepUpdated\". This tool disappeared in 0.18, but was re-implemented for 0.19; [forum discussion](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=38956).
-   The new [App Link](App_Link.md) object is now supported as a source for creating views; [forum discussion](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=41973), [commit 37b578bf49](http://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/commit/37b578bf49).
-   The center marks created from circular edges, can now be printed; [pull request #2335](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/2335), [#2962](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/2962).
-   It is now possible to override displayed values for tolerances, for example to use text in tolerances. Furthermore, one can now use a custom display format for each, over- and undertolerance. [pull request #4087](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/4087)
-   The [LineGroup](TechDraw_LineGroup.md) to set the default line widths for drawings can now be selected from the available groups in the [preferences](TechDraw_Preferences#Annotation.md). [pull request #4083](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/4083)

## Web

-   QtWebEngine support for Qt 5.7 and above, and fallback to QWebkit for Qt 5.6 and below; [pull request #1937](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/1937).

### A2plus

+++
| <img alt="" src=images/A2plus.jpg  style="width:384px;"> | The successor to the Assembly2 workbench, [A2plus](A2plus_Workbench.md) is the most mature assembly workbench, and has received important updates in this development cycle, like an improved point on plane constraint, and point on line constraint, using the center of a sphere as the point; this improves the constraining of spheres.

|                                           | Please note: A2plus is not compatible with Assembly2 or other assembly workbenches.

### Assembly3

+++
| <img alt="" src=images/Assembly3_0.19.png  style="width:384px;"> | [Assembly3](Assembly3_Workbench.md) is an assembly workbench created by developer **realthunder**, that is inspired by [Assembly2](Assembly2_Workbench.md), but is not compatible with it. Assembly3 makes use of realthunder\'s [App Link](App_Link.md) object and various significant changes to the internal code of FreeCAD. Because of this reason, Assembly3 cannot be installed simply from the Addon Manager. Instead, realthunder provides a pre-compiled version of FreeCAD that includes Assembly3. This workbench serves as a testing environment for the [App Link](App_Link.md) object, and other changes that realthunder plans to submit to the main FreeCAD source code. |

### Assembly4

+++
| <img alt="" src=images/Assembly4_0.19.png  style="width:384px;"> | [Assembly4](Assembly4_Workbench.md) is an assembly workbench created by developer **Zolko**, that uses realthunder\'s [App Link](App_Link.md) object and many other changes to the base FreeCAD system, particularly the new [expression engine](expressions.md). Because of this, Assembly4 doesn\'t work with versions below 0.19. Assembly4 can be installed from the [Addon Manager](Std_AddonMgr.md). |

### ArchTextures

+++
| <img alt="" src=images/ArchTextures_0.19.png  style="width:384px;"> | The ArchTextures Workbench was developed to provide basic texture support to [Arch Workbench](Arch_Workbench.md) elements like walls and roofs, in order to quickly visualize a building. It is not intended to produce photo-realistic renderings, just simple texturing of materials like wood, brick, and concrete. It also provides lights (directional, point, and spot), which makes it more feature complete to set up a scene.

### BOLTSFC

+++
| <img alt="" src=images/BOLTSFC_0.19.png  style="width:384px;"> | BOLTS is an \"open library of technical specifications\"; it is meant to provide free, standardized parts defined parametrically that can be used in different CAD systems like OpenSCAD and FreeCAD. The BOLTS library was launched in 2013 but received little maintenance since 2016. Now, with a new maintainer and repository, the project has revived with the BOLTSFC workbench that provides an interface to insert the different parametric objects.

### CurvedShapes Workbench 

+++
| <img alt="" src=images/Curved_shapes_wb.png  style="width:384px;"> | The CurvedShapes workbench has tools for designing 3D surfaces starting from a skeleton of multiple curves in the XY, XZ, or YZ planes. It was created particularly to simplify the modelling of the wings of aircrafts.

### Dodo (formerly Flamingo) 

+++
| <img alt="" src=images/FlamingoBlob.png  style="width:384px;"> | Dodo is the successor to the [Flamingo Workbench](Flamingo_Workbench.md), a workbench specialized in creating piping and frames.

### MeshRemodel Workbench 

+++
| <img alt="" src=images/MeshRemodel_Workbench_0.19.png  style="width:384px;"> | This workbench helps convert a mesh, for example, an imported STL file, into a native FreeCAD object. It will not do the conversion automatically, but it will help re-build, or re-model, the imported mesh. The general workflow is to select the mesh object, then create a \"points\" object from it; then these points can be used as references for creating FreeCAD objects such as lines, polygons, circles, arcs, and BSplines. These wires can then be turned into a [Sketch](Sketcher_Workbench.md) object, which can be padded to create a 3D solid with the [PartDesign Workbench](PartDesign_Workbench.md). |

### NodeEditor (PyFlow) 

+++
| <img alt="" src=images/NodeEditor_0.19.png  style="width:384px;"> | The NodeEditor workbench implements a system of nodes that can be used to dynamically control the properties of objects, similar to Blender\'s node system to edit materials.

|                                                             | A node editor has been a requested feature for a very long time, at least since 2014 (see [this thread](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=7442)). A fully working node editor has the potential of simplifying the drawing of complex shapes using generative algorithms that produce a shape based on the values of its inputs. This could be used to create various types of meshes and surfaces with many applications in architecture and mechanical design. |

| <img alt="" src=images/Geomatics_Workbench_0.19.png  style="width:384px;"> | The **Geomatics** workbench provides functionality specific to survey engineering, such as importing geodata information, and creating surfaces from clouds of points.
