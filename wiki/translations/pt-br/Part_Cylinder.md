# Part Cylinder/pt-br

## Description

The <img alt="" src=images/Part_Cylinder.svg  style="width:24px;"> **Part Cylinder** command creates a parametric cylinder solid. It is the result of extruding a circular arc along a straight path. In the coordinate system defined by its **Placement** property, the bottom face of the cylinder lies on the XY plane with its center at the origin.

A Part Cylinder can be turned into a segment of a cylinder by changing its **Angle** property.

## Usage

1.  There are several ways to invoke the command:
    -   Press the **<img src="images/Part_Cylinder.svg" width=16px> [Part Cylinder](Part_Cylinder.md)** button.
    -   Select the **Part → Primitives → <img src="images/Part_Cylinder.svg" width=16px> Cylinder** option from the menu.
2.  The cylinder is created.
3.  Optionally change the dimensions and **Placement** of the cylinder by doing one of the following:
    -   Double-click the object in the [Tree view](Tree_view.md):
        1.  The **Geometric Primitives** task panel opens.
        2.  Change one or more properties.
        3.  The object is dynamically updated in the [3D view](3D_view.md).
        4.  Press the **OK** button.
    -   Change the properties in the [Property editor](Property_editor.md).
    -   Change the **Placement** with the <img alt="" src=images/Std_TransformManip.svg  style="width:16px;"> [Std TransformManip](Std_TransformManip.md) command.

## Example

![Part Cylinder from the scripting example](images/Part_Cylinder_Scripting_Example.png )

A Part Cylinder object created with the [scripting example](#Scripting.md) below is shown here.

## Notes

-   A Part Cylinder can also be created with the <img alt="" src=images/Part_Primitives.svg  style="width:16px;"> [Part Primitives](Part_Primitives.md) command. With that command you can specify the dimensions and placement at creation time.

## Properties

See also: [Property editor](Property_editor.md).

A Part Cylinder object is derived from a [Part Feature](Part_Feature.md) object and inherits all its properties. It also has the following additional properties:

### Data


{{TitleProperty|Attachment}}

The object has the same attachment properties as a [Part Part2DObject](Part_Part2DObject#Data.md).


{{TitleProperty|Cylinder}}

-    **Radius|Length**: The radius of the circular arc that defines the cylinder. The default is {{Value|2mm}}.

-    **Height|Length**: The height of the cylinder. The default is {{Value|10mm}}.

-    **Angle|Angle**: The angle of the circular arc that defines the cylinder. Valid range: {{Value|0° &lt; value &lt;&#61; 360°}}. The default is {{Value|360°}}. If it is smaller than {{Value|360°}} the resulting solid will be a segment of a cylinder.


{{TitleProperty|Prism}}

-    **First Angle|Angle**: The angle between the extrusion direction of the cylinder and its positive Z axis, measured around its Y axis. The angle is positive towards its positive X axis. Valid range: {{Value|0° &lt;&#61; value &lt; 90°}}. The default is {{Value|0°}}. <small>(v0.20)</small> 

-    **Second Angle|Angle**: The angle between the extrusion direction of the cylinder and its positive Z axis, measured around its X axis. The angle is positive towards its positive Y axis. Valid range: {{Value|0° &lt;&#61; value &lt; 90°}}. The default is {{Value|0°}}. <small>(v0.20)</small> 

## Scripting

See also: [Autogenerated API documentation](https://freecad.github.io/SourceDoc/), [Part scripting](Part_scripting.md) and [FreeCAD Scripting Basics](FreeCAD_Scripting_Basics.md).

A Part Cylinder can be created with the {{Incode|addObject()}} method of the document:


```python
cylinder = FreeCAD.ActiveDocument.addObject("Part::Cylinder", "myCylinder")
```

-   Where {{Incode|"myCylinder"}} is the name for the object.
-   The function returns the newly created object.

Example:


```python
import FreeCAD as App

doc = App.activeDocument()

cylinder = doc.addObject("Part::Cylinder", "myCylinder")
cylinder.Radius = 10
cylinder.Height = 50
cylinder.Placement = App.Placement(App.Vector(5, 10, 15), App.Rotation(75, 60, 30))

doc.recompute()
```
