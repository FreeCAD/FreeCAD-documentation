# Std ViewFullscreen/ko

## Description

The **Std ViewFullscreen** command switches [3D views](3D_view.md) to and from fullscreen mode. 3D views are automatically [undocked](Std_ViewDockUndockFullscreen.md) for fullscreen mode.

## Usage

1.  Activate the correct 3D view.
2.  There are several ways to invoke the command   *
    -   Select the **View → Document window → <img src="images/Std_ViewFullscreen.svg" width=16px> Fullscreen** option from the menu. This option does not work if you want to switch off fullscreen mode and there are other docked 3D views.
    -   Select the **Document window → <img src="images/Std_ViewFullscreen.svg" width=16px> Fullscreen** option from the 3D view context menu.
    -   Use the keyboard shortcut   * **F11**.

## Notes

-   Multiple 3D views for the same document can be created with the [Std ViewCreate](Std_ViewCreate.md) command.
-   3D views can also be docked and undocked with the [Std ViewDockUndockFullscreen](Std_ViewDockUndockFullscreen.md) command.
