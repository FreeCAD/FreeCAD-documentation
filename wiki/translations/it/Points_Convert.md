# Points Convert/it




<div class="mw-translate-fuzzy">

## Descrizione


</div>

The **Points Convert** command creates point clouds from shape objects or mesh objects.

Here a shape object refers any object with a **Shape** property. Objects created with the [Part](Part_Workbench.md) and [PartDesign](PartDesign_Workbench.md) workbench are shape objects. But so are objects created with the [Sketcher](Sketcher_Workbench.md) and [Draft](Draft_Workbench.md) workbench.
