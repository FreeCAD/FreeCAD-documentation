# Category:Template:Text Long/it
This category lists templates that produce long texts, either long paragraphs, lists, or tables.

These templates should not be used. The long textual elements should be placed on the wiki page itself, so that they can be translated directly by the translation extension.

These long pages should not be transcluded; rather, the information should be placed in a page, and other pages should link to that information.
