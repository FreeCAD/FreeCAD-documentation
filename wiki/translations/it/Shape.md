# Shape/it
## Introduzione

In FreeCAD the word \"[Shape](Shape.md)\" is normally used to refer to a [Part TopoShape](Part_TopoShape.md) (`Part::TopoShape` class), a type of object that gives an element its 3D geometrical and parametric representation (cube, pyramid, sphere, cylinder, fusion, etc.).

Essentially all objects that are displayed in the [3D view](3D_view.md) have a [TopoShape](Part_TopoShape.md), with the exception of \"[Meshes](Mesh.md)\", which have a [MeshObject](Mesh_MeshObject.md) (`Mesh::MeshObject` class).

See [Part TopoShape](Part_TopoShape.md) for more information about this type of object.

## Usage

Shapes are normally created by internal functions of the [Part Workbench](Part_Workbench.md), and are ultimately defined by the [OpenCASCADE Technology](OpenCASCADE.md) kernel (OCCT).

Once a Shape is created, it can be used and modified by all [workbenches](Workbenches.md) by creating [scripted objects](scripted_objects.md) around that Shape.

Essentially, every object derived from a [Part Feature](Part_Feature.md) (`Part::Feature` class) is expected to hold and manipulate a Shape.

Any OpenCascade Shape has a tesselation mainly to view the Shape on screen. More information about this can be found in this German [forum post](https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?t=77521&start=10#p674947) and in the [OpenCascad Mesh documentation](https://dev.opencascade.org/doc/overview/html/occt_user_guides__mesh.html).

## Notes

In informal usage, a \"Shape\" may be any geometrical figure that is visible in the [3D view](3D_view.md), and thus its concept may be confused with that of \"[Body](Body.md)\" or \"[Part](Part.md)\".

However, when more precision is required, the distinction must be made.

-   A \"[Body](Body.md)\" is an object derived from a [Part Feature](Part_Feature.md) (`Part::Feature` class), created with the [PartDesign Workbench](PartDesign_Workbench.md).
-   A \"Shape\" is an internal object, embedded within the \"[Body](Body.md)\".
-   A \"[Part](Part.md)\" is used to group several \"[Bodies](Body.md)\" to form an [assembly](assembly.md). A \"Part\" has a collection of \"Shapes\", but doesn\'t have a \"Shape\" of its own.
