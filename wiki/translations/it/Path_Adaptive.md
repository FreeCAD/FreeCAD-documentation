## Descrizione

The <img alt="" src=images/Path_Adaptive.svg  style="width:24px;"> [Adaptive](Path_Adaptive.md) tool uses an adaptive algorithm to create clearing and profiling paths that manage cutter engagement so that engagement and material removal never exceed a maximum value.



## Utilizzo

Usage instructions for the [Adaptive](Path_Adaptive.md) operation are presented here.

#### Basic Operation 

1.  Press the **<img src="images/Path_Adaptive.svg" width=16px> [Adaptive](Path_Adaptive.md)** icon, or select the **Path** → **<img src="images/Path_Adaptive.svg" width=24px> [Adaptive](Path_Adaptive.md)** from the top menu.
2.  Select the tool controller for the Operation from the Tool controller dialogue pop up window, if prompted.
3.  Adjust the operation depths as needed in the Depths tab: Start Depth, Finish Depth, Step Down.
4.  Make adjustments in Heights tab if needed.
5.  Configure settings in the Operations tab:
    1.  (**See the [Properties](#Properties.md) → Adaptive section below.**)
    2.  Set the Step Over value as a percentage of the diameter of the Tool.
6.  If you wish to preview the result before accepting the settings, click **Apply**
7.  Click **OK** button to confirm and generate paths.

##### Preliminary Notes About Adaptive Clearing 

-   Depending on the size and complexity of the area for the operation, is might be better to not recompute the operation after every property change; rather, consider:
    -   deactivate the operation with the **<img src="images/Path_OpActiveToggle.svg" width=16px> [Active](Path_OpActiveToggle.md)** toggle tool, make your changes to the operation\'s properties, then click the **<img src="images/Path_OpActiveToggle.svg" width=16px> [Active](Path_OpActiveToggle.md)** icon again to re-activate the operation - which triggers a recompute internally.
-   The **<img src="images/Path_Adaptive.svg" width=16px> [Adaptive](Path_Adaptive.md)** operation might contain a few bugs yet to be clearly identified. Please report bugs and issues in the [FreeCAD Path/CAM Forum](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewforum.php?f=15).
-   All tool shapes may not be respected with this operation. Check the FreeCAD forum for further details.
-   Should you choose to run the path simulator in the Path Workbench, it only uses the standard end mill to simulate paths. Therefore, you will not see tool-shape-specific material removal. Material removal is shown using the end mill shape.



## Proprietà

***Note***: The names of some Properties in this list differ a little from the same settings used in the Task Window Editor.


{{TitleProperty|Adaptive}}

-    **Force Inside-Out**: Force plunging into material inside and clearing towards the edges

-    **Helix Angle**: Helix ramp entry angle (degrees)

-    **Helix Cone Angle**: Angle (degrees) of conical helix

-    **Helix Diameter Limit**: Limit helix entry diameter, if limit larger than tool diameter or 0, tool diameter is used

-    **Keep Tool Down Ratio**: Max length of keep tool down path compared to direct distance between points

-    **Lift Distance**: Lift distance for rapid moves

-    **Operation Type**: Type of adaptive operation: Clearing or Profiling

-    **Step Over**: Percent of cutter diameter to step over on each pass

-    **Stock to Leave**: How much stock to leave (i.e. for a separate finishing operation)

-    **Tolerance**: Influences accuracy and performance

-    **Use Helix Arcs**: Use Arcs (G2) for helix ramp


{{TitleProperty|Base}}

    -   
        **Angle**
        
        : Angle in degrees applied to rotation of the object around Axis property value

    -   
        **Axis**
        
        : Axis (one or multiple) around which to rotate the object, set in sub-properties: X, Y, Z

        -   
            **X**

        -   
            **Z**
            
            : Z axis value

    -   
        **Position**

        -   
            **X**
            
            : X distance value

        -   
            **Y**
            
            : Y distance value

## Known Issues 

In case Path Adaptive creates some unwanted paths, try with a **Stock to Leave** set to {{Value|0.001 mm}} or more. You can reduce the diameter of the tool by double that amount to keep the paths exact.

A proposed bugfix is available (but no one is working on integrating it):
