# Drawing API example/ro
## Introducere

Fluxul de lucru pentru interfața grafică pentru [Drawing Workbench](Drawing_Workbench.md) este limitat, astfel încât API-ul de scripting este mai interesant.

## Exemplu Simplu 

Mai întâi aveți nevoie de modulul Parte și de desen: 
```python
import FreeCAD, Part, Drawing
```

Create a small sample part 
```python
Part.show(Part.makeBox(100,100,100).cut(Part.makeCylinder(80,100)).cut(Part.makeBox(90,40,100)).cut(Part.makeBox(20,85,100)))
```

Direct projection. The G0 means hard edge, the G1 is tangent continuous. 
```python
Shape = App.ActiveDocument.Shape.Shape
[visibleG0,visibleG1,hiddenG0,hiddenG1] = Drawing.project(Shape)
print "visible edges:", len(visibleG0.Edges)
print "hidden edges:", len(hiddenG0.Edges)
```

Everything was projected on the Z-plane: 
```python
print "Bnd Box shape: X=",Shape.BoundBox.XLength," Y=",Shape.BoundBox.YLength," Z=",Shape.BoundBox.ZLength
print "Bnd Box project: X=",visibleG0.BoundBox.XLength," Y=",visibleG0.BoundBox.YLength," Z=",visibleG0.BoundBox.ZLength
```

Different projection vector 
```python
[visibleG0,visibleG1,hiddenG0,hiddenG1] = Drawing.project(Shape,App.Vector(1,1,1))
```

Project to SVG 
```python
resultSVG = Drawing.projectToSVG(Shape,App.Vector(1,1,1))
print resultSVG
```

## Parametric example 

Create the body 
```python
import FreeCAD
import Part
import Drawing

# Create three boxes and a cylinder
App.ActiveDocument.addObject("Part::Box","Box")
App.ActiveDocument.Box.Length=100.00
App.ActiveDocument.Box.Width=100.00
App.ActiveDocument.Box.Height=100.00

App.ActiveDocument.addObject("Part::Box","Box1")
App.ActiveDocument.Box1.Length=90.00
App.ActiveDocument.Box1.Width=40.00
App.ActiveDocument.Box1.Height=100.00

App.ActiveDocument.addObject("Part::Box","Box2")
App.ActiveDocument.Box2.Length=20.00
App.ActiveDocument.Box2.Width=85.00
App.ActiveDocument.Box2.Height=100.00

App.ActiveDocument.addObject("Part::Cylinder","Cylinder")
App.ActiveDocument.Cylinder.Radius=80.00
App.ActiveDocument.Cylinder.Height=100.00
App.ActiveDocument.Cylinder.Angle=360.00
# Fuse two boxes and the cylinder
App.ActiveDocument.addObject("Part::Fuse","Fusion")
App.ActiveDocument.Fusion.Base = App.ActiveDocument.Cylinder
App.ActiveDocument.Fusion.Tool = App.ActiveDocument.Box1

App.ActiveDocument.addObject("Part::Fuse","Fusion1")
App.ActiveDocument.Fusion1.Base = App.ActiveDocument.Box2
App.ActiveDocument.Fusion1.Tool = App.ActiveDocument.Fusion
# Cut the fused shapes from the first box
App.ActiveDocument.addObject("Part::Cut","Shape")
App.ActiveDocument.Shape.Base = App.ActiveDocument.Box 
App.ActiveDocument.Shape.Tool = App.ActiveDocument.Fusion1
# Hide all the intermediate shapes 
Gui.ActiveDocument.Box.Visibility=False
Gui.ActiveDocument.Box1.Visibility=False
Gui.ActiveDocument.Box2.Visibility=False
Gui.ActiveDocument.Cylinder.Visibility=False
Gui.ActiveDocument.Fusion.Visibility=False
Gui.ActiveDocument.Fusion1.Visibility=False
```

Insert a Page object and assign a template 
```python
App.ActiveDocument.addObject('Drawing::FeaturePage','Page')
App.ActiveDocument.Page.Template = App.getResourceDir()+'Mod/Drawing/Templates/A3_Landscape.svg'
```

Create a view on the \"Shape\" object, define the position and scale and assign it to a Page 
```python
App.ActiveDocument.addObject('Drawing::FeatureViewPart','View')
App.ActiveDocument.View.Source = App.ActiveDocument.Shape
App.ActiveDocument.View.Direction = (0.0,0.0,1.0)
App.ActiveDocument.View.X = 10.0
App.ActiveDocument.View.Y = 10.0
App.ActiveDocument.Page.addObject(App.ActiveDocument.View)
```

Create a second view on the same object but this time the view will be rotated by 90 degrees. 
```python
App.ActiveDocument.addObject('Drawing::FeatureViewPart','ViewRot')
App.ActiveDocument.ViewRot.Source = App.ActiveDocument.Shape
App.ActiveDocument.ViewRot.Direction = (0.0,0.0,1.0)
App.ActiveDocument.ViewRot.X = 290.0
App.ActiveDocument.ViewRot.Y = 30.0
App.ActiveDocument.ViewRot.Scale = 1.0
App.ActiveDocument.ViewRot.Rotation = 90.0
App.ActiveDocument.Page.addObject(App.ActiveDocument.ViewRot) 
```

Create a third view on the same object but with an isometric view direction. The hidden lines are activated too. 
```python
App.ActiveDocument.addObject('Drawing::FeatureViewPart','ViewIso')
App.ActiveDocument.ViewIso.Source = App.ActiveDocument.Shape
App.ActiveDocument.ViewIso.Direction = (1.0,1.0,1.0)
App.ActiveDocument.ViewIso.X = 335.0
App.ActiveDocument.ViewIso.Y = 140.0
App.ActiveDocument.ViewIso.ShowHiddenLines = True
App.ActiveDocument.Page.addObject(App.ActiveDocument.ViewIso) 
```

Change something and update. The update process changes the view and the page. 
```python
App.ActiveDocument.View.X = 30.0
App.ActiveDocument.View.Y = 30.0
App.ActiveDocument.View.Scale = 1.5
App.ActiveDocument.recompute()
```

## Accessing the bits and pieces 

Get the SVG fragment of a single view 
```python
ViewSVG = App.ActiveDocument.View.ViewResult
print ViewSVG
```

Get the whole result page (it\'s a file in the document\'s temporary directory, only read permission) 
```python
print "Resulting SVG document: ",App.ActiveDocument.Page.PageResult
file = open(App.ActiveDocument.Page.PageResult,"r")
print "Result page is ",len(file.readlines())," lines long"
```

Important: free the file! 
```python
del file
```

Insert a view with your own content: 
```python
App.ActiveDocument.addObject('Drawing::FeatureView','ViewSelf')
App.ActiveDocument.ViewSelf.ViewResult = """<g id="ViewSelf"
  stroke="rgb(0, 0, 0)"
  stroke-width="0.35"
  stroke-linecap="butt"
  stroke-linejoin="miter"
  transform="translate(30,30)"
  fill="#00cc00"
  >

  <ellipse cx="40" cy="40" rx="30" ry="15"/>
  </g>"""
App.ActiveDocument.Page.addObject(App.ActiveDocument.ViewSelf)
App.ActiveDocument.recompute()

del ViewSVG
```

That leads to the following result:

## General dimensioning and tolerancing 


**See also:**

[Drawing Dimensioning Addon](Drawing_Dimensioning_Addon.md)

Drawing dimensions an tolerances are still under development but you can get some basic functionality with a bit of work.

First you need to get the gdtsvg python module from here (WARNING: This could be broken at any time!):

<https://github.com/jcc242/FreeCAD>

To get a feature control frame, try out the following: 
```python
import gdtsvg as g # Import the module, I like to give it an easy handle
ourFrame = g.ControlFrame("0","0", g.Perpendicularity(), ".5", g.Diameter(), g.ModifyingSymbols("M"), "A",  
           g.ModifyingSymbols("F"), "B", g.ModifyingSymbols("L"), "C", g.ModifyingSymbols("I"))
```

Here is a good breakdown of the contents of a feature control frame: <http://www.cadblog.net/adding-geometric-tolerances.htm>

The parameters to pass to control frame are:

1.  X-coordinate in SVG-coordinate system (type string)
2.  Y-coordinate in SVG-coordinate system (type string)
3.  The desired geometric characteristic symbol (tuple, svg string as first, width of symbol as second, height of symbol as third)
4.  The tolerance (type string)
5.  (optional) The diameter symbol (tuple, svg string as first, width of symbol as second, height of symbol as third)
6.  (optional) The condition modifying material (tuple, svg string as first, width of symbol as second, height of symbol as third)
7.  (optional) The first datum (type string)
8.  (optional) The first datum\'s modifying condition (tuple, svg string as first, width of symbol as second, height of symbol as third)
9.  (optional) The second datum (type string)
10. (optional) The second datum\'s modifying condition (tuple, svg string as first, width of symbol as second, height of symbol as third)
11. (optional) The third datum (type string)
12. (optional) The third datum\'s material condition (tuple, svg string as first, width of symbol as second, height of symbol as third)

The ControlFrame function returns a type containing (svg string, overall width of control frame, overall height of control frame)\'\'\'

To get a dimension, try out the following: 
```python
import gdtsvg
ourDimension = linearDimension(point1, point2, textpoint, dimensiontext, linestyle=getStyle("visible"), 
               arrowstyle=getStyle("filled"), textstyle=getStyle("text")
```

Inputs for linear dimension are:

1.  point1, an (x,y) tuple with svg-coordinates, this is one of the points you would like to dimension between
2.  point2, an (x,y) tuple with svg-coordinates, this is the second point you would like to dimension between
3.  textpoint, an (x,y) tuple of svg-coordinates, this is where the text of your dimension will be
4.  dimensiontext, a string containing the text you want the dimension to say
5.  linestyle, a string containing svg (i.e. css) styles, using the getStyle function to retrieve a preset string, for styling the how the lines look
6.  arrowstyle, a string containing svg (i.e. css) styles, using the getStyle function to retrieve a preset string, for styling how the arrows look
7.  textstyle, a string containing svg (i.e. css) styles, using the getStyle function to retrieve a preset string, for styling how the text looks

With those two, you can proceed as above for displaying them on the drawing page. This module is very buggy and can be broken at any given moment, bug reports are welcome on the github page for now, or contact jcc242 on the forums if you post a bug somewhere else.
