## Introducere

Pentru a putea face o analiză a elementelor finite (FEA) utilizând [FEM Worbench](FEM_Workbench.md) FreeCAD folosește două programe externe. Una este folosită pentru generarea FEM-Mesh, iar cealaltă pentru rezolvarea sistemului de ecuații. Dacă FreeCAD este configurat pentru a face analiza elementului mecanic finit, ar putea fi ușor verificată prin încărcarea și analizarea unui fișier exemplu. Vedeți [FEM_CalculiX_Cantilever_3D](FEM_CalculiX_Cantilever_3D.md)


</div>

To be able to perform finite element analysis (FEA) within the **<img src="images/Workbench_FEM.svg" width=24px> [FEM Workbench](FEM_Workbench.md)**, FreeCAD makes use of two external programs: one is used for generating the [FEM Mesh](FEM_Mesh.md), and the other for numerically solving the actual analysis. You can test if your FreeCAD installation is ready for FEA by running the [FEM CalculiX Cantilever 3D](FEM_CalculiX_Cantilever_3D.md) example which is included with every installation of FreeCAD since v0.17.

<div class="mw-translate-fuzzy">

##### Rezolvitor FEM 

Acesta este utilizat pentru rezolvarea sistemului de ecuații CalculiX. Vezi <http://www.calculix.de/> FreeCAD scrie un fișier de intrare CalculiX pornește CalculiX și citește ieșirea CalculiX. Aceasta înseamnă că calculiX binar este independent și independent de FreeCAD. Din acest motiv și din moment ce există mai multe posibilități de obținere a unui FEM Mesh valid, se recomandă să instalați mai întâi Solver. Până în prezent (mijlocul anului 2015) CalculiX este singurul Solver suportat al modulului FEM.


</div>

The default solver to perform finite element calculations is [CalculiX](FEM_CalculiX.md), a simple solver for analysis of structures. FreeCAD writes a CalculiX input file, starts the solver, and reads the output, which can then be presented visually in the viewport; this means the CalculiX binary is standalone and independent from FreeCAD. Given that there are many programs that can generate a mesh, **it is recommended to install the solver, and make sure it\'s working first**.

If the solver is correctly installed, you may run the single command `ccx` in the terminal to obtain a simple response:


{{SystemInput|User@PC:~$ ccx}}


```python
Usage: CalculiX.exe -i jobname
```

If the solver is installed, make sure the FEM Workbench is able to find the binary; go to **Edit → Preferences → FEM → CalculiX → Search in known binary directories**. If you compiled the solver yourself, untick the option, and give the correct path to the binary. For other solvers that could be used with FreeCAD, see [FEM Solver](FEM_Solver.md).

### FEM mesh generator 

In order to create a [FEM Mesh](FEM_Mesh.md), FreeCAD uses [Gmsh](http://gmsh.info/) as the default mesher. Depending on your operating system and your FreeCAD installation Gmsh may be bundled with the FreeCAD installation binaries. If it is not, you can install it separately from FreeCAD and then use the menu **Edit → Preferences → FEM → Gmsh** to set the path to the *gmsh.exe*.

If the program is correctly installed, you may run the command `gmsh` in the terminal to launch the graphical interface of the program. This interface is not used by FreeCAD but demonstrates that the program is installed.


{{SystemInput|User@PC:~$ gmsh -info}}

If the mesher is installed, make sure the FEM Workbench is able to find the binary; go to **Edit → Preferences → FEM → Gmsh → Search in known binary directories**. If you compiled the mesher yourself, untick the option, and give the correct path to the binary. See [FEM Mesh](FEM_Mesh.md) for various possibilities of obtaining a valid mesh for analysis.

### Netgen

In order to create a FEM Mesh, you can use *Netgen* as an alternative to *Gmsh*. Depending on your operating system and your FreeCAD installation Netgen may be bundled with the FreeCAD installation binaries.

If the program is correctly installed, you can run the command `netgen` in the terminal under Linux to launch the graphical interface of the program.


{{SystemInput|User@PC:~$ netgen -V}}

## Installing on Windows 

The FreeCAD packages available from the [download](Download.md) page already include Netgen and CalculiX, so no additional software needs to be installed. Some links where to get a better Calculix executable than included in FreeCAD can be found here [alternative ccx executables](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=58792&start=10#p506164)


<div class="mw-collapsible mw-collapsed toccolours">

## Installing on Linux 

Linux distributions have different ways of installing software. Many distributions have software repositories and package managers; before compiling source code, look in your package manager for `netgen`, `gmsh`, `calculix-ccx` or `ccx`, and install them following the instructions of your own distribution.


<div class="mw-collapsible-content">

### Ubuntu PPA 

The [freecad-stable](https://launchpad.net/~freecad-maintainers/+archive/ubuntu/freecad-stable) and [freecad-daily](https://launchpad.net/~freecad-maintainers/+archive/ubuntu/freecad-daily) personal package archives (PPA) provide a more recent version of FreeCAD than is available in the official Ubuntu repositories. These PPAs include the most recent `netgen`, `gmsh`, and `calculix-ccx` packages as well. See [Installing on Linux](Installing_on_Linux.md) for more information on setting up the repositories.

If a PPA is already added to your system, install the packages as follows


```python
sudo apt-get install netgen
sudo apt-get install gmsh
sudo apt-get install calculix-ccx
```

The [freecad-community](https://launchpad.net/~freecad-community/+archive/ubuntu/ppa) PPA also provides `netgen`, `gmsh`, and `calculix-ccx` packages for testing. If they are stable enough, they may be added to the daily or stable repositories. The binaries for ccx 2.14 work on Debian Stretch, but not on Debian Buster due to dependency problems.


**Note:**

the thread [Ubuntu Repository](http://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=10393) discusses the creation of the Ubuntu PPA packages. At the time it was written, CalculiX was not included in the Debian repositories, so there were several personal packages in Launchpad. Only one package should be installed.

### Arch Linux 

Get the CalculiX package from the [AUR repository](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/calculix/).

### Debian

-   Debian 9 Buster: the packages in the [repository](https://packages.debian.org/buster/calculix-ccx) are outdated, but you can use the packages from the Ubuntu PPA (`freecad-community`). See [Gmsh 4 package available for testing in Community Extras PPA](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=31360&start=10#p279925) (forum post).
-   Debian 8 Stretch: the packages in the [repository](https://packages.debian.org/stretch/calculix-ccx) are outdated, but you can use the packages from the Ubuntu PPA (`freecad-community`). See [Gmsh 4 package available for testing in Community Extras PPA](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=31360&p=279925#p260872) (forum post).
-   Debian 7 Jessie: install the packages from Debian 8 Stretch using `dpkg`. See [Debian source package for Calculix](http://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=5975&p=110597#p110597) (forum post).

### openSUSE

-   [openSUSE:Science Math](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Science_Math#Mesh_Generation_and_Related_Tools)
-   [netgen Automatic 3D tetrahedral mesh generator](https://software.opensuse.org/package/netgen)
-   [gmsh A three-dimensional finite element mesh generator](https://software.opensuse.org/package/gmsh)
-   [ccx An open source finite element package](https://software.opensuse.org/package/ccx)

Additional packages are typically installed with YAST (abbr. Yet another Setup Tool) the Linux operating system setup and configuration tool, or in any terminal/console (root rights required) with:

:   
    
```python
    zypper install netgen
    zypper install gmsh
    zypper install ccx
    
```
    

### CalculiX binary 

The CalculiX authors provide a pre-compiled Linux binary of the solver; it can be downloaded from the [authors\' website](http://www.dhondt.de/). However, since different Linux distributions have different library paths, most likely this binary will not work without making some adjustments.

To use the binary with Fedora 21, see the thread [Making FEM run on linux fedora 21](http://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=10140). For newer Fedora versions, you should compile CalculiX yourself.

If you use this binary, check that the binary is executable, that it is in the executable `$PATH` of your system, and that you have the necessary version of the libraries (`libgfortran`, `liblapack`, `libblas`, etc.) against which it was compiled. This is mentioned in the forum post [FEM WB](http://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=11830&start=20#p95741).

Use the command `ldd` to see the libraries that are linked by the binary. Install any missing dependency.

### Compile CalculiX 

Since CalculiX is a standalone application, you can either install a binary packaged for your distribution, or compile it yourself. Any CalculiX version from 2.7.x onwards should work with FreeCAD, and since the code hasn\'t changed much in years, lower versions than 2.7.x may work as well.

Compiling CalculiX is a task for experienced users, requiring editing the Makefiles and build options in different platforms. See the following information:

-   Debian: [Debian source package for Calculix](http://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=5975&start=10), [Gmsh 4 package available for testing in Community Extras PPA](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=31360&start=10#p260506), [Compiling CalculiX ccx on fedora, ubuntu and debian](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=34024).
-   Fedora 27, 28, 29: [Compiling CalculiX ccx on fedora, ubuntu and debian](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=34024).
-   There is a CMake version of the source package in a [github repository](https://github.com/ricortiz/CalculiX-cmake), but at the FreeCAD forums no one has reported if this package works.

### Compile Netgen 

Netgen was originally linked by FreeCAD when FreeCAD used OCE, the community fork of OpenCascade (OCCT). As OCE lagged in development behind OCCT, FreeCAD switched back to OCCT. This broke the linking of Netgen, which could only link against OCCT 6.9 or OCE 0.18 and below. As OCCT 7.x versions improved the core funcitonality of FreeCAD, it was decided to drop Netgen support in favor of Gmsh.

Since then some success has been achieved patching and linking newer versions of Netgen against OCCT 7.x. Nevertheless, the inclusion of Netgen with FreeCAD is still problematic.
