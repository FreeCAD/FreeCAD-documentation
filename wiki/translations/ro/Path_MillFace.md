## Description

The <img alt="" src=images/Path_MillFace.svg  style="width:24px;"> [Mill Face](Path_MillFace.md) tool creates a path to perform a facing operation on a horizontal surface. This operation is generally used:

-   to smooth out a rough stock surface,
-   to mill selected face(s) to desired depth in preparation for performing subsequent clearing operations within the boundary of the regions affected by this operation,
-   or to apply a finishing surface to the selected face(s).

This operation contains a **BoundaryShape** property that allows for a modified selection area based upon the selected face(s).

## Usage

1.  Select one or more faces to be surfaced. **Note:** If selected faces exist at different heights, then all will be milled to the Final Depth setting.
2.  There are several ways to invoke the command:
    -   Press the **<img src="images/Path_MillFace.svg" width=16px> [Path MillFace](Path_MillFace.md)** button.
    -   Select the **Path → <img src="images/Path_MillFace.svg" width=16px> Face** option from the menu.
3.  Select the correct **BoundaryShape** setting to modify the milling area based on the face(s) selected as **Base Geometry**.
4.  Adjust the other properties as needed. They are listed further below.

## Caveats

-   Using it on an inclined plane may produce unexpected results: it will still produce a path to cut a horizontal surface. The extent of the cut will be the vertical projection of the inclined plane, performed at a height corresponding to the lowest point in that plane.

-   Since the path tools work on the geometry of the selected edges/faces only, and do not relate to the rest of the 3D model, the paths will not go beyond the bounds of the chosen plane, even if it is surrounded by unused stock or air. This will leave unmachined corners. These can sometimes removed with one of the dress-up tools to be found on the *Path* menu.

## Vertical face milling 

-   This tool will not work on a **vertical plane** or vertical non planar surface. Vertical operations can be achieved by using the [face profile](Path_Profile.md) tool or [edge profile](Path_Profile.md) tool. These will need the selection of a face or closed loop of edges *including the top or bottom edge of the vertical surface desired*). The extent of the path can then be reduced using the [Boundary Dress-up](Path_DressupPathBoundary.md) tool to be found on the *Path* menu. With the Dress-up tool, select *Create Box* option and reduce the size to limit the scope of the profile path. These settings will not allow the origin of the boundary box to be moved, however. This must be done by adjusting the Placement settings in the [tree view](Tree_view.md).
-   This will work on compound surfaces such as several vertical planes or cylindrical surfaces joined together, so long as they form one continuous surface.

## Properties

***Note***: The names of some Properties in this list differ a little from the same settings used in the Task Window Editor.

### Data


{{TitleProperty|Base}}

Note: It is suggested that you do not edit the Placement property of path operations. Rather, move or rotate the Path Job model as needed.

    -   
        **Angle**
        
        : Angle in degrees applied to rotation of the object around Axis property value

    -   
        **Axis**
        
        : Axis (one or multiple) around which to rotate the object, set in sub-properties: X, Y, Z
