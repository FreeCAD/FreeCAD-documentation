## Description

The **Std SceneInspector** command opens a dialog box displaying an overview of all nodes in the [scenegraph](Scenegraph.md) of the active [3D view](3D_view.md). It is more a utility for programmers than for average users. It can be used to find out why the rendering is slow or why something isn\'t rendered properly.

## Usage

1.  Select the **Tools → <img src="images/Std_SceneInspector.svg" width=16px> Scene inspector...** option from the menu.
2.  The Scene inspector dialog box opens.
3.  The dialog box is modeless, meaning it can stay open while you continue working in FreeCAD.
4.  Optionally press the **Refresh** to update the overview.
5.  Press the **Close** button to close the dialog box.
