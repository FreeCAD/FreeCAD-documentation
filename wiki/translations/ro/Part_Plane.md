# Part Plane/ro

## Description


<div class="mw-translate-fuzzy">

## Descriere

Create a simple parametric plane 10 x 10 mm, with the parameters of position, length, and width. By default, the plane is positioned at the origin (0,0,0).

<div class="mw-translate-fuzzy">

## Cum se utilizează 

The standard plane is created with its lower left corner at the origin point 0,0,0. To change these parameters, open the Location section and enter the desired values ​​in the respective input fields, or click on the 3D view and select a point, the point coordinates are taken from the fields. In the Direction menu you can also define a standard vector (X, Y or Z) normal to the plane, or click User Defined \... to open the dialog box that allows you to set a different carrier (eg direction 1.0 , -1 creates a plane inclined 45 ° with respect to X and Z).


</div>

See [Part Primitives](Part_Primitives#Usage.md).

## Example

![Part Plane from the scripting example](images/Part_Plane_Scripting_Example.png )

A Part Plane object created with the [scripting example](#Scripting.md) below is shown here.

## Properties

See also: [Property editor](Property_editor.md).

A Part Plane object is derived from a [Part Feature](Part_Feature.md) object and inherits all its properties. It also has the following additional properties:

### Data


{{TitleProperty|Attachment}}

The object has the same attachment properties as a [Part Part2DObject](Part_Part2DObject#Data.md).


{{TitleProperty|Plane}}

-    **Length|Length**: The length of the plane. This is the dimension in its X direction. The default is {{Value|10mm}}.

-    **Width|Length**: The width of the plane. This is the dimension in its Y direction. The default is {{Value|10mm}}.

## Scripting

See also: [Autogenerated API documentation](https://freecad.github.io/SourceDoc/), [Part scripting](Part_scripting.md) and [FreeCAD Scripting Basics](FreeCAD_Scripting_Basics.md).

A Part Plane can be created with the {{Incode|addObject()}} method of the document:


```python
plane = FreeCAD.ActiveDocument.addObject("Part::Plane", "myPlane")
```

-   Where {{Incode|"myPlane"}} is the name for the object.
-   The function returns the newly created object.

Example:


```python
import FreeCAD as App

doc = App.activeDocument()

plane = doc.addObject("Part::Plane", "myPlane")
plane.Length = 4
plane.Width = 8
plane.Placement = App.Placement(App.Vector(1, 2, 3), App.Rotation(20, 75, 60))

doc.recompute()
```
