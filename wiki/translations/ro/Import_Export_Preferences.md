### Preference DXF 

The **DXF settings** configure how [DXF files](Draft_DXF.md) must be imported ([FreeCAD_and_DXF_Import](FreeCAD_and_DXF_Import.md)). ![](images/Preference_Import_Export_Tab_01.png )

## Introduction

FreeCAD can import and export many file formats. For some formats dedicated preferences exist. These can be found in the [Preferences editor](Preferences_Editor.md), in the menu **Edit → Preferences → Import-Export**.

Not all import and export preferences tabs are available by default. For some a workbench has to be loaded first.

## Notes

### TechDraw pages 

The DXF and SVG preferences listed here are not used by the <img alt="" src=images/TechDraw_ExportPageSVG.svg  style="width:24px;"> [Export Page as SVG](TechDraw_ExportPageSVG.md) and <img alt="" src=images/TechDraw_ExportPageDXF.svg  style="width:24px;"> [Export Page as DXF](TechDraw_ExportPageDXF.md) commands of the <img alt="" src=images/Workbench_TechDraw.svg  style="width:24px;"> [TechDraw Workbench](TechDraw_Workbench.md), or by the [TechDraw](TechDraw_Workbench.md) export option: **File → Export → Technical Drawing (*.svg *.dxf *.pdf)**.

### OpenSCAD files 

The import and export preferences for OpenSCAD files are listed in a different part of the [Preferences editor](Preferences_Editor.md). See the [OpenSCAD Preferences](OpenSCAD_Preferences.md).

### DAE

The [Collada](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COLLADA) DAE (Digital Asset Exchange) format is a standard file format for exchange of Mesh data. FreeCAD can import meshes from **.dae** files, and export [Shape](Part_Workbench.md)-based objects to the **.dae** format.

Note for Linux users: To handle this file format FreeCAD requires the [pyCollada module](Extra_python_modules.md).

For the DAE format you can specify the following:

### DWG

DWG (from drawing) is a proprietary, closed source, binary file format for storing 2D and 3D design data and metadata. FreeCAD requires external converters to process DWG files.

**Note:** All settings for the DXF file format also apply to DWG.

For the DWG format you can specify the following:

### IGES

The [Initial Graphics Exchange Specification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IGES) (IGES) file format is a file format that allows the digital exchange of information among CAD systems. After publication of the [STEP](Preferences_Editor#STEP.md) file format, IGES development was stopped in 1996, but it is still supported by many CAD programs. IGES files have the **.iges** or **.igs** extension.

The tab *IGES* is only shown in the preferences if the <img alt="" src=images/Workbench_Part.svg  style="width:24px;"> [Part Workbench](Part_Workbench.md), <img alt="" src=images/Workbench_PartDesign.svg  style="width:24px;"> [PartDesign Workbench](PartDesign_Workbench.md), or <img alt="" src=images/Workbench_OpenSCAD.svg  style="width:24px;"> [OpenSCAD Workbench](OpenSCAD_Workbench.md) has been loaded in the current FreeCAD session.

For the IGES format you can specify the following:

### IFC

[Industry Foundation Classes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry_Foundation_Classes) (IFC) is a wide spread format to exchange data between [BIM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_Information_Modeling) applications. It is used in architecture and engineering.

Note for Linux users: To handle this file format FreeCAD requires the [IfcOpenShell module](Extra_python_modules.md).

#### IFC import 

For import of the IFC format you can specify the following:

### Mesh Formats 

Meshes are a special type of 3D object, composed of triangular faces connected by their [vertices](Glossary#Vertex.md) and edges. They are widely used for [additive manufacturing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printing). FreeCAD provides the <img alt="" src=images/Workbench_Mesh.svg  style="width:24px;"> [Mesh Workbench](Mesh_Workbench.md) to create and handle meshes. FreeCAD supports several mesh file formats.

The tab *Mesh Formats* is only shown in the preferences if the <img alt="" src=images/Workbench_Mesh.svg  style="width:24px;"> [Mesh Workbench](Mesh_Workbench.md) has been loaded in the current FreeCAD session.

For the Mesh formats you can specify the following:

### OCA

The [OCA](http://groups.google.com/group/open_cad_format) file format is a community project to create a free, simple and open CAD file format. OCA is largely based on the GCAD file format generated by [gCAD3D](http://www.gcad3d.org/). Both formats can be imported in FreeCAD and the OCA files exported by FreeCAD can be opened in gCAD3D.

For the OCA format you can specify the following:

+++
| Name                             | Description                                            |
+==================================+========================================================+
|                   | If checked, the areas (3D faces) will be imported too. |
| **Import OCA areas** |                                                        |
|                               |                                                        |

### STEP

The [Standard for The Exchange of Product model data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_10303) (STEP) file format is an ISO standard for the computer-interpretable representation and exchange of product manufacturing information. STEP is commonly used to exchange 3D data between CAD software. STEP files have the **.step** or **.stp** extension. For compressed files the **.stpz** extension is used.

The tab *STEP* is only shown in the preferences if the <img alt="" src=images/Workbench_Part.svg  style="width:24px;"> [Part Workbench](Part_Workbench.md), <img alt="" src=images/Workbench_PartDesign.svg  style="width:24px;"> [PartDesign Workbench](PartDesign_Workbench.md), or <img alt="" src=images/Workbench_OpenSCAD.svg  style="width:24px;"> [OpenSCAD Workbench](OpenSCAD_Workbench.md) has been loaded in the current FreeCAD session.

### SVG

[Scalable Vector Graphics](SVG.md) (SVG) is a [vector image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics) format for two-dimensional graphics. A vector image can be scaled to any size without losing its shape or details. An SVG image can be converted to bitmap formats like PNG or JPEG for printing.

For the SVG format you can specify the following:

### VTK

The [Visualization Toolkit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VTK) (VTK) is an open-source, freely available software system for 3D computer graphics, image processing and visualization. VTK files are used by the <img alt="" src=images/Workbench_FEM.svg  style="width:24px;"> [FEM Workbench](FEM_Workbench.md) for the [post processing](FEM_Post_Processing_based_on_VTK.md) of simulation results.

The tab *VTK* is only shown in the preferences if the <img alt="" src=images/Workbench_FEM.svg  style="width:24px;"> [FEM Workbench](FEM_Workbench.md) has been loaded in the current FreeCAD session.

For the VTK format you can specify the following:

|                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|                                             | If **FEM mesh object** is selected, the results in the VTK file will be omitted, only the mesh data will be imported and a FreeCAD FEM mesh object will be created.                                                                                 |
|                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|                                             | If **FreeCAD result object** is selected, the imported data will be converted into a FreeCAD FEM Result object. **Note:** this setting needs the exact result component names and thus it only works properly with VTK files exported from FreeCAD. |
