## Description

The <img alt="" src=images/Draft_Heal.svg  style="width:24px;"> **Draft Heal** command heals problematic [Draft](Draft_Workbench.md) objects found in very old files. It tries to recreate the old objects from scratch and transfer their properties to the new objects.

## Usage

1.  Optionally select one or more problematic objects. If no objects are selected the entire document will be processed.
2.  Select the **Utilities → <img src="images/Draft_Heal.svg" width=16px> Heal** option from the menu.
3.  If no errors are found the command will do nothing.
