This is the place to come if you want to contribute to the development of the FreeCAD software.

These pages are in the early stage of development. If you can\'t find the information you are looking for, or have found useful information somewhere we have not linked to, then please leave a comment on the [forum](http://forum.freecadweb.org/index.php?sid=5f84150e79db8842e277b042077097ff) and someone will look into it (or, if you are feeling bold, why not edit this page directly!).

## Developer Documentation 

The developer documentation comprises the following sections:

### Internals

#### OpenCascade Documentation 

OpenCascade is a software development platform for 3D surface and solid modeling, CAD data exchange, and visualization, mostly in the form of C++ libraries.

-   [Roman Lygin\'s tutorials](http://opencascade.wikidot.com/romansarticles)
-   [Full Online Documentation](https://dev.opencascade.org/cdoc/overview/html/index.html)
-   [Reference Manual](https://dev.opencascade.org/doc/refman/html/index.html)
-   [The openCascade wiki](http://opencascade.wikidot.com) (currently containing ?? Chinese spam)

#### File format 

[File Format FCStd](File_Format_FCStd.md). The files created with FreeCAD are `.zip` files that include the [BREP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_representation) geometry, as well as XML data that describes the document.

#### Sketcher solver 

-   [Sketcher Solver Architecture Booklet](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=36355) (forum thread), [source](https://github.com/abdullahtahiriyo/FreeCADBooks/tree/master/FreeCAD_Solver_Architecture) in GitHub.
-   [PlaneGCS solver](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/blob/master/src/Mod/Sketcher/App/planegcs/) in the FreeCAD source code; important files are [GCS.cpp](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/blob/master/src/Mod/Sketcher/App/planegcs/GCS.cpp) and [SubSystem.cpp](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/blob/master/src/Mod/Sketcher/App/planegcs/SubSystem.cpp).
-   [Recent Several Sketcher improvements](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=29192).

The sketcher solver isn\'t perfect, as there are some issues with numerical precision when using large values, see [Adventure of fixing sketcher solver for large sketches](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=40502).

The development of a new solver architecture could improve the way the solver is used both in the [Sketcher Workbench](Sketcher_Workbench.md), and for assembly of 3D bodies. See [Reimplementing constraint solver](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=20&t=40525).

## Roadmap

FreeCAD, though usable in certain areas, is at the beginning of a long way into the CAD mainstream. There is still a lot to do to reach a state where we can compete with commercial software.
