In FreeCAD it is needed to display the geometric shapes in the 3D-view. The tessellation relative to the dimensions of a shape can be set in the preferences to get a smoother view of round surfaces at the cost of computation time. See [Preferences Editor](Preferences_Editor.md).}}


{{term|Thickness}}


{{defn|no=1|defn=A measure of how thick a shape is.}}


{{defn|no=2|defn=A [Part](Part_Workbench.md) [workbench](#Workbench.md) tool to hollow out a solid and leave a defined uniform thickness.}}


{{term|Toggle}}


{{defn|defn=A setting that can be changed between two options, for example between True or False or between Off and On.}}


{{term|Topological Naming}}


{{defn|defn=A scheme whereby an edge or face, once created, is assigned a permanent name. Internally, FreeCAD identifies edges and faces on a solid by numbering them such as: Edge1, Edge2, Face1, Face2, etc. The problem is that these IDs are somewhat randomly applied, and they will change after something is done to the model that changes the amount of edges and faces. For example, if the model is revised an item linked to a Face2 could later erroneously become linked to a different face (which was renamed to become the new Face2), causing the user unwanted results.  As of the FreeCAD 0.20 release Topological Naming has not yet been implemented, and so if an object is modified such that the number of edges or faces changes, the names of the edges or faces of that object might change too.}}


{{term|Torus}}


{{defn|defn=A primitive shape.}}


{{term|Tracker}}


{{defn|defn=Short for bug tracker, the online software application used to keep track of reported bugs or feature requests. See also [Mantis](#Mantis.md).}}


{{term|Tree view|content=[Tree view](Tree_view.md)}}


{{defn|defn=The Tree view is a component of the FreeCAD [interface](Interface.md). It can be shown as a separate [GUI](#GUI.md) element or as part of the [Combo View](Combo_View.md). It contains a representation of the document's structure.}}

{{defn|defn=具有方向与大小的量。在2D与3D空间的图示中，常以带箭头的线段加以表示。例如，“向北走50步”、“向下9.8 m/s^2（重力加速度）”以及“在x、y、z方向分别为(3,5,6)个单位”皆为向量。在FreeCAD中，通常将向量表示为有序对(x, y)或有序三元组(x, y, z)。}}


{{term|顶点（Vertex）}}


{{defn|defn=空间中的单独[点（point）](#Point.md)，或[图形（shape）](#shape.md)中[边（edges）](#Edge.md)间的交点。Open Cascade Technology将其定义为：对应于几何图形中点的零维[图形（shape）](#shape.md)。[ 参见OCCT Profile: Defining the topology](https://dev.opencascade.org/doc/overview/html/occt__tutorial.html#OCCT_TUTORIAL_SUB2_3.md)}}
