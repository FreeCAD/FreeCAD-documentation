# Std TileWindows/ru



## Описание

The **Std TileWindows** command rearranges the windows in the [Main view area](Main_view_area.md) so that they are all visible and do not overlap. The result is determined by the order in which the windows were last activated.

<img alt="" src=images/Std_TileWindows_example.png  style="width:400px;"> 
*Main view area with three tiled windows*



## Применение

1.  The Main view area must contain at least two windows.
2.  Select the **Windows → <img src="images/Std_TileWindows.svg" width=16px> Tile** option from the menu.
