# Fasteners Shape/ru

## Описание

The <img alt="" src=images/Fasteners_Shape.svg  style="width:24px;"> **Fasteners Shape** command creates non-parametric copies of fasteners. This can be useful if you want to share a document containing fasteners with users who do not have the [Fasteners Workbench](Fasteners_Workbench.md) installed.

## Применение

1.  Select one or more fasteners.
2.  There are several ways to invoke the command:
    -   Press the **<img src="images/Fasteners_Shape.svg" width=16px> [Simplify shape](Fasteners_Shape.md)** button.
    -   Select the **Fasteners → <img src="images/Fasteners_Shape.svg" width=16px> Simplify shape** option from the menu.
3.  For each fastener a simplified copy is created.
4.  The **Visibility** property of the original fasteners is set to `False`.
5.  Optionally delete the original fasteners.
