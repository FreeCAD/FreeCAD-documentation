# Combo view/ru
## Введение

The [Combo view](Combo_view.md) appears in a panel called **Model**. It combines the [Tree view](Tree_view.md) (upper section) and the [Property editor](Property_editor.md) (lower section).

The [Task panel](Task_panel.md), which used to be part of the Combo view, is a separate panel called **Tasks** in <small>(v1.0)</small> . It can be [docked](#Dock_Task_panel_on_top_of_Combo_view.md) on top of the Combo view to achieve the compact layout of earlier versions.
