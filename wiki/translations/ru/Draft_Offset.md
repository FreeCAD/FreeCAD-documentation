# Draft Offset/ru


</div>



## Описание

The <img alt="" src=images/Draft_Offset.svg  style="width:24px;"> **Draft Offset** command offsets each segment of a selected object over a given distance, or creates an offset copy of the selected object.

*Offsetting a Draft Wire*



## Применение

See also: [Draft Snap](Draft_Snap.md) and [Draft Constrain](Draft_Constrain.md).

1.  Optionally select one object. The object must lie on the current [Draft working plane](Draft_SelectPlane.md).
2.  There are several ways to invoke the command:
    -   Press the **<img src="images/Draft_Offset.svg" width=16px> [Offset](Draft_Offset.md)** button.
    -   [Draft](Draft_Workbench.md): Select the **Modification → <img src="images/Draft_Offset.svg" width=16px> Offset** option from the menu.
    -   [BIM](BIM_Workbench.md): Select the **Modify → <img src="images/Draft_Offset.svg" width=16px> Offset** option from the menu.
    -   Use the keyboard shortcut: **O** then **S**.
3.  If you have not yet selected an object: select an object in the [3D view](3D_view.md).
4.  The **Offset** task panel opens. See [Options](#Options.md) for more information.
5.  To define the offset distance do one of the following:
    -   Pick a point in the [3D view](3D_view.md).
    -   Enter a numerical value:
        1.  Make sure the pointer is on the correct side of the object in the [3D view](3D_view.md).
        2.  Do not move the pointer out of the [3D view](3D_view.md).
        3.  Enter a **Distance**.
        4.  Press **Enter** to finish the command.

## Options

The single character keyboard shortcuts available in the task panel can be changed. See [Draft Preferences](Draft_Preferences.md). The shortcuts mentioned here are the default shortcuts (for version 1.0).

-   If the **OCC-style offset** checkbox is checked a special offset style is used: open [Draft Wires](Draft_Wire.md) are offset on both sides, and new edges are connected with rounded corners. This only works for planar objects with at least two edges. Note that with this style a new non-parametric object is created, and if copy mode is off the original object is deleted.
-   Press **C** or click the **Copy** checkbox to toggle copy mode. If copy mode is on, the command will create an offset copy instead of offsetting the original object.
-   Holding down **Alt** before picking points in the [3D view](3D_view.md) will also toggle copy mode. While **Alt** is held down multiple offset points can be picked. Release **Alt** to finish the command and see the created copies.
-   Hold down **Shift** to keep the offset distance linked to the current segment.
-   Press **S** to switch [Draft snapping](Draft_Snap.md) on or off.
-   Press **Esc** or the **Close** button to abort the command.



## Примечания

-   To create an offset version of a [Draft BSpline](Draft_BSpline.md) its points are offset individually, and from the new points a new spline is calculated. This new spline is not parallel to the original spline. For an exact parallel offset of a [Draft BSpline](Draft_BSpline.md) the [Part Offset2D](Part_Offset2D.md) command should be used.
-   The Draft Offset command cannot handle [Draft BezCurves](Draft_BezCurve.md). Use the [Part Offset2D](Part_Offset2D.md) command instead.



## Программирование

See also: [Autogenerated API documentation](https://freecad.github.io/SourceDoc/) and [FreeCAD Scripting Basics](FreeCAD_Scripting_Basics.md).

To offset objects use the `offset` method of the Draft module. The method can only handle [Draft Wires](Draft_Wire.md), [Draft Circles](Draft_Circle.md), [Draft Rectangles](Draft_Rectangle.md), [Draft Polygons](Draft_Polygon.md) and [Draft BSplines](Draft_BSpline.md).


```python
offset_obj = offset(obj, delta, copy=False, bind=False, sym=False, occ=False)
```

-    `obj`is the object to be offset.

-    `delta`contains the offset information:

    -   For [Draft Wires](Draft_Wire.md), [Draft Rectangles](Draft_Rectangle.md) and [Draft Polygons](Draft_Polygon.md) it is an offset vector that must be perpendicular to the first segment of the object.
    -   For [Draft Circles](Draft_Circle.md) it is the new radius.
    -   For [Draft BSplines](Draft_BSpline.md) it is a list of new points.

-   If `copy` is `True` the original object is kept and a new object is created.

-   If `bind` is `True` a face is created by connecting the shape of the original object and the shape of its offset. This only works for open [Draft Wires](Draft_Wire.md).

-   If `sym` is `True`, and `bind` is `True` as well, the offset is made on both sides of the original object, the total width being the length of the given vector. This only works for open [Draft Wires](Draft_Wire.md).

-   If `occ` is `True` OCC-style offsetting is used. See [Options](#Options.md). If `occ` is `True` the `bind` and `sym` arguments are ignored.

-    `offset_obj`is returned with the original offset object, or with the new object. If `bind` is `True` or `occ` is `True`, the new object is a `[Part::Feature](Part_Feature.md)` object.

Пример:


```python
import FreeCAD as App
import Draft

doc = App.newDocument()

p1 = App.Vector(0, 0, 0)
p2 = App.Vector(1500, 2000, 0)
p3 = App.Vector(4000, 0, 0)

wire = Draft.make_wire([p1, p2, p3])
doc.recompute()

vector = App.Vector(-200, 150, 0)
offset1 = Draft.offset(wire, vector, copy=True, bind=True, sym=True)
offset2 = Draft.offset(wire, 3*vector, copy=True)
offset3 = Draft.offset(wire, 6*vector, copy=True)
offset4 = Draft.offset(wire, 9*vector, copy=True)
offset5 = Draft.offset(wire, 1.5*vector, copy=True, occ=True)

doc.recompute()
```
