# Migrating to FreeCAD from SolidWorks/ru
## Обзор

The intention of this page is to serve as a guide for users that are accustomed to the SolidWorks CAD/CAM workflow and want to migrate to FreeCAD.

## History

Understanding a little of the history of FreeCAD may help users comprehend it better:

-   FreeCAD was initially designed to behave parametrically using the [Constructive solid geometry](Constructive_solid_geometry.md) method (see the <img alt="" src=images/Workbench_Part.svg  style="width:24px;"> [Part Workbench](Part_Workbench.md)).
-   Later it incorporated the [Feature editing](Feature_editing.md) method with the <img alt="" src=images/Workbench_PartDesign.svg  style="width:24px;"> [PartDesign Workbench](PartDesign_Workbench.md). SolidWorks also uses this approach.

## Tips

The [PartDesign Workbench](PartDesign_Workbench.md) has many functions that are equivalent to SolidWorks. The image below identifies equivalent functions and their names on each platform, as well as functions that are unique to each platform.

## Topological naming problem 

FreeCAD version 0.20 is still affected by the [Topological naming problem](Topological_naming_problem.md), but there are plans to fix this in the next version.

There are many video tutorials online. Some of the more popular (at the time this was written) are by a Youtuber calling himself [**Joko Engineeringhelp**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-CubOaooNwC-3RBKUoAOQQ/videos).

One of his tutorials is meant specifically for former SolidWorks users: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XXnulyKPNI>
