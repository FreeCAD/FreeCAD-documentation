## Introduction

The preferences for the <img alt="" src=images/Workbench_Sketcher.svg  style="width:24px;"> [Sketcher Workbench](Sketcher_Workbench.md) can be found in the [Preferences Editor](Preferences_Editor.md). In the menu select **Edit → Preferences...** and then **<img src="images/Workbench_Sketcher.svg" width=16px> Sketcher**. This group is only available if the Sketcher Workbench has been loaded in the current FreeCAD session.

There are four pages: [General](#General.md), [Grid](#Grid.md), [Display](#Display.md) and [Appearance](#Appearance.md).

Some advanced preferences can only be changed in the [Parameter editor](Std_DlgParameter.md). See [Fine-tuning](Fine-tuning#Sketcher_Workbench.md).

This page has been updated for version 1.0.

In {{VersionMinus|0.21}} the [Appearance](#Appearance.md) page is labeled \"Colors\".

|                                            | If checked, a special solver algorithm will be used while dragging sketch elements. This avoids that the sketch flips around while dragging. It is an improvement for most cases, however for complex sketches this option can increase the time to solve the sketch.                                                                                                                                                                       |

For example if the endpoints of two arcs are connected with the [coincident constraint](Sketcher_ConstrainCoincident.md) and you reconnect the arcs using the [tangent constraint](Sketcher_ConstrainTangent.md), the coincidence constraint will be substituted by the tangent constraint and you will get a popup dialog telling you this. |

|                       | The grid spacing threshold in pixels. Only used if **Grid Auto Spacing** is enabled. If the onscreen spacing is smaller than this value, physical grid spacing is multiplied by the **Major grid lines every** value. If the onscreen spacing is larger than the threshold value times the **every** value, physical grid spacing is divided by the **every** value. If the **every** value is set to 1, 10 is used instead in these calculations. |

The colors for selections while a sketch is in edit mode are controlled by the global settings **Enable preselection highlighting** and **Enable selection highlighting**, see the [Preferences Editor](Preferences_Editor#Selection.md).

The size of the vertices in edit mode is controlled by the **Marker size** [setting](Preferences_Editor#3D_View.md).

## Note

There is another preference that has an influence on sketches. If the **Transparent objects** preference on the [Display → 3D View](Preferences_Editor#3D_View.md) tab is set to {{Value|Backface pass}}, arrowheads on one end of sketch dimensions are hidden on some systems. When viewed from the rear the dimension value can then also be hidden. Versions 0.19 to 0.21 (except Link branch) are affected. In versions 0.19 and 0.20 the effect only occurs if **Show grid** is deactivated in the [Edit controls](Sketcher_Dialog#Edit_controls.md) section of the [Task panel](Task_panel.md) as shown below.
