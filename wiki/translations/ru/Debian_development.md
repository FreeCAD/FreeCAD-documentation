# Debian development/ru
Debian is the parent distribution from which many other Linux distributions are derived, such as Ubuntu, Linux Mint, and others. As such, it\'s worthwhile to focus specifically on Debian development since improvements in Debian will filter down through its descendants.

[Debian Unstable](Debian_Unstable.md) is a good target distribution for FreeCAD development on Linux since it provides the most up-to-date packages possible, as a rolling distribution. One can contribute both to FreeCAD development on Debian as well as its ecosystem of related packages and dependencies.
