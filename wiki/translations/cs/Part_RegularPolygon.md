## Description

A <img alt="" src=images/Part_RegularPolygon.svg  style="width:24px;"> **Part RegularPolygon** is a parametric shape that can be created with the <img alt="" src=images/Part_Primitives.svg  style="width:24px;"> [Part Primitives](Part_Primitives.md) command. In the coordinate system defined by its **Placement** property, the polygon lies on the XY plane with its center at the origin and one of its vertices on the X axis.

## Usage

See [Part Primitives](Part_Primitives#Usage.md).

## Example

![Part RegularPolygon from the scripting example](images/Part_RegularPolygon_Scripting_Example.png )

A Part RegularPolygon object created with the [scripting example](#Scripting.md) below is shown here.

## Properties

See also: [Property editor](Property_editor.md).

A Part RegularPolygon object is derived from a [Part Feature](Part_Feature.md) object and inherits all its properties. It also has the following additional properties:

### Data


{{TitleProperty|Attachment}}

The object has the same attachment properties as a [Part Part2DObject](Part_Part2DObject#Data.md).


{{TitleProperty|Regular Polygon}}

-    **Polygon|IntegerConstraint**: The number of sides of the polygon. The default is {{Value|6}}.

-    **Circumradius|Length**: The radius of the circle that circumscribes the polygon, the distance from the center of the polygon to one of its vertices. The default is {{Value|2mm}}.

## Scripting

See also: [Autogenerated API documentation](https://freecad.github.io/SourceDoc/), [Part scripting](Part_scripting.md) and [FreeCAD Scripting Basics](FreeCAD_Scripting_Basics.md).

A Part RegularPolygon can be created with the {{Incode|addObject()}} method of the document:


```python
poly = FreeCAD.ActiveDocument.addObject("Part::RegularPolygon", "myPolygon")
```

-   Where {{Incode|"myPolygon"}} is the name for the object.
-   The function returns the newly created object.

Example:


```python
import FreeCAD as App

doc = App.activeDocument()

poly = doc.addObject("Part::RegularPolygon", "myPolygon")
poly.Polygon = 5
poly.Circumradius = 8
poly.Placement = App.Placement(App.Vector(1, 2, 3), App.Rotation(60, 30, 15))

doc.recompute()
```
