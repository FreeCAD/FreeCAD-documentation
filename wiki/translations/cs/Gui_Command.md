# Gui Command/cs
{{TOCright}}

The GuiCommand is one of the most important functions of FreeCAD in the main interaction point of the user. Every time the user selects a menu item or presses a toolbar button it activates a GuiCommand. Some of the attributes of a GuiCommand are:

-   Defines a name
-   Contains an icon
-   Defines the scope for an undo/redo
-   Has a help page
-   Opens and controls dialogs
-   Macro recording
-   and others.

## Naming

The GuiCommand is named in a standard way: *ModuleName_CommandName* e.g., \"[Base_Open](Base_Open.md)\" this is the Open Gui Command in the Base system. The GuiCommand in a certain module is named with the module name in front e.g., \"[Part_Cylinder](Part_Cylinder.md)\".

If the documentation is not finished use [Template:UnfinishedDocu](Template_UnfinishedDocu.md).

## Help page 

Every GuiCommand has to have a help page. The help page is hosted on the FreeCAD documentation wiki. The article has the same name as the GuiCommand, e.g. [Draft ShapeString](Draft_ShapeString.md).

To create your own help pages you can use the template [GuiCommand model](GuiCommand_model.md)

Example:

-   [Draft ShapeString](Draft_ShapeString.md)
-   [Draft Line](Draft_Line.md)

## Icons

Every GuiCommand has to have an icon. We use the [Tango icon set](http://tango-project.org/Tango_Desktop_Project/) and its guidelines. On the right side you see the tango color palette.

All icons should be created in [SVG](SVG.md) format with a vector image application, such as [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org). This makes it easier to apply changes and derive additional icons in the same application space.

### Icons color coding chart

We try as much as possible to respect this chart, so the color of the icons has a direct meaning.
