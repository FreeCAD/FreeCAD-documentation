# Image Open/es

## Descripción

The [Image Open](Image_Open.md) tool simply opens an image from your system in a new tab in the viewport.

## Usage

1.  Press the **<img src="images/Image_Open.svg" width=16px> [Image Open](Image_Open.md)** button.
2.  Select the image file that you want.

The image is placed in a new viewport, not in the 3D view.
