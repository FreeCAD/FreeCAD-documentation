# Sketcher Preferences/es
The preferences for the <img alt="" src=images/Workbench_Sketcher.svg  style="width:24px;"> [Sketcher Workbench](Sketcher_Workbench.md) can be found in the [Preferences Editor](Preferences_Editor.md). In the menu select **Edit → Preferences...** and then **Sketcher**.

There are four tabs: [General](#General.md), [Grid](#Grid.md), [Display](#Display.md) and [Colors](#Colors.md).

## General

On the *General* tab you can specify the following:

|                       | The grid spacing threshold in pixels. Only used if **Grid Auto Spacing** is enabled. If the onscreen spacing is smaller than this value, physical grid spacing is multiplied by the **Major grid lines every** value. If the onscreen spacing is larger than the threshold value times the **every** value, physical grid spacing is divided by the **every** value. If the **every** value is set to 1, 10 is used instead in these calculations. |

*Hint:* The color for selections inside sketches is the global selection setting **Enable selection highlighting**, see the [Preferences Editor](Preferences_Editor#Colors.md).

## Note

There is another preference that has an influence on sketches. If the **Transparent objects** preference on the [Display → 3D View](Preferences_Editor#3D_View.md) tab is set to {{Value|Backface pass}}, arrowheads on one end of sketch dimensions are hidden on some systems. When viewed from the rear the dimension value can then also be hidden. Versions 0.19 to 0.21 (except Link branch) are affected. In versions 0.19 and 0.20 the effect only occurs if **Show grid** is deactivated in the [Edit controls](Sketcher_Dialog#Edit_controls.md) section of the [Task panel](Task_panel.md) as shown below.

See [forum topic](https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?t=70975&start=10).
