## Description

A <img alt="" src=images/Part_Spiral.svg  style="width:24px;"> **Part Spiral** is a parametric shape that can be created with the <img alt="" src=images/Part_Primitives.svg  style="width:24px;"> [Part Primitives](Part_Primitives.md) command. In the coordinate system defined by its **Placement** property, the spiral lies on the XY plane with its center at the origin and its start point on the X axis. It widens as it turns counterclockwise.

## Usage

See [Part Primitives](Part_Primitives#Usage.md).

## Example

![Part Spiral from the scripting example](images/Part_Spiral_Scripting_Example.png )

A Part Spiral object created with the [scripting example](#Scripting.md) below is shown here.

## Properties

See also: [Property editor](Property_editor.md).

A Part Spiral object is derived from a [Part Feature](Part_Feature.md) object and inherits all its properties. It also has the following additional properties:

### Data


{{TitleProperty|Attachment}}

The object has the same attachment properties as a [Part Part2DObject](Part_Part2DObject#Data.md).


{{TitleProperty|Spiral}}

-    **Growth|Length**: The distance between two consecutive turns of the spiral. The default is {{Value|1mm}}.

-    **Radius|Length**: The start radius of the spiral, the distance between its center and its start point. Can be {{Value|0mm}}. The default is {{Value|1mm}}.

-    **Rotations|QuantityConstraint**: The number of rotations, or turns, of the spiral. The default is {{Value|2}}.

-    **Segment Length|QuantityConstraint**: The number of turns per spiral subdivision. The default is {{Value|1}}, meaning each full turn of the spiral is a separate segment. Use {{Value|0}} to suppress subdivision.

## Scripting

See also: [Autogenerated API documentation](https://freecad.github.io/SourceDoc/), [Part scripting](Part_scripting.md) and [FreeCAD Scripting Basics](FreeCAD_Scripting_Basics.md).

A Part Spiral can be created with the {{Incode|addObject()}} method of the document:


```python
spiral = FreeCAD.ActiveDocument.addObject("Part::Spiral", "mySpiral")
```

-   Where {{Incode|"mySpiral"}} is the name for the object.
-   The function returns the newly created object.

Example:


```python
import FreeCAD as App

doc = App.activeDocument()

spiral = doc.addObject("Part::Spiral", "mySpiral")
spiral.Growth = 2
spiral.Radius = 3
spiral.Rotations = 4
spiral.Placement = App.Placement(App.Vector(1, 2, 3), App.Rotation(75, 60, 30))

doc.recompute()
```
