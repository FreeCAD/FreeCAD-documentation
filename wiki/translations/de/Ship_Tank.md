# Ship Tank/de


</div>



## Beschreibung

Create a new tank instance in a ship instance.

Tank instances are so far similar to **Weight instances** (see [Ship Weight](Ship_Weight.md)), i.e. they act as weights that shall be considered for the center of gravity and displacement computation. However, they have small differences in the inputs required to setup a tank instance, as well as in the way its contribution to the ship weight is computed. Along this line tanks can only be created on top of solid/volumetric geometries, and the density is not queried until they are added to a **load condition** (see [Ship LoadCondition](Ship_LoadCondition.md)). Afterwards, their contribution to the ship weight and center of gravity will depend on the filling level (to be defined in the **load condition**) and the ship roll and trim angle, as long as the fluid inside reshapes, effectively affecting the gravity center position (the so-called free-surface effect).



## Anwendung

In order to create a weight, select the tank solid geometry (the interior of the tank that will be eventually filled with fluids) and invoke **Weights â†’ <img src="images/Ship_Tank.svg" width=16px> Create a new tank**.

The task panel is shown, where you must select the **Ship instance** (see [Ship CreateShip](Ship_CreateShip.md)) in which the tank shall be added.

When the **Accept** button is pressed, a new tank instance is created inside the chosen **Ship instance**.
