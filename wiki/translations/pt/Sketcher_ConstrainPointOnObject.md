# Sketcher ConstrainPointOnObject/pt


</div>

## Description

Affixes a point onto another object such as a line, arc, or sketch axis.

## Usage

1.  Select a point and an edge in any order.
2.  There are several ways to invoke the command:
    -   Press the **[<img src=images/Sketcher_ConstrainPointOnObject.svg style="width:16px"> [Constrain point onto object](Sketcher_ConstrainPointOnObject.md)** button in the toolbar.
    -   Use the **O** keyboard shortcut.
    -   Use the **Sketch → Sketcher constraints → [<img src=images/Sketcher_ConstrainPointOnObject.svg style="width:16px"> Constrain point onto object** entry in the top menu.

## Scripting

The constraint can be created from [macros](Macros.md) and from the [Python](Python.md) console by using the following command:


`Sketch.addConstraint(Sketcher.Constraint('PointOnObject',LineMoving,PointOfLineMoving,LineFixed))`

-    `Sketch`is a sketch object.

-    `LineMoving`is the number that designates the line, which contains the point that has to be moved onto the `LineFixed` (the line which is fixed).

-    `PointOfLineMoving`is the number of the vertex of line `LineMoving`, that has to be moved onto the `LineFixed`.

-    `LinedFixed`is the number of the line to be affixed onto the point `PointOfLineMoving`.

The [Sketcher scripting](Sketcher_scripting.md) page explains how to identify the numbers that designate lines and points.
