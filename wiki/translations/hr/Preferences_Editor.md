# Preferences Editor/hr
## Predstavljanje

To start the **Preferences editor** select the **Edit → Preferences...** option from the menu or (<small>(v1.1)</small> ) use the keyboard shortcut **Ctrl**+**,**. On macOS the **Preferences...** option appears in the **FreeCAD** menu instead (this is the default place for preferences on the Mac).

FreeCAD uses a workbench concept, where each workbench is responsible for specific tasks and functions. A workbench can have its own preferences. These will only appear in the Preferences editor, usually in a dedicated group, if the workbench has been loaded in the current FreeCAD session. Some workbenches add support for specific import and export formats. If there are any related preferences they will appear on one or more additional pages in the [Import-Export](#Import-Export.md) group of the Preferences editor.

To preserve resources, FreeCAD does not automatically load all available workbenches. See [Workbenches](#Workbenches.md) for more information. For a list of workbench related preferences see [Workbench related preferences](#Workbench_related_preferences.md).

If no workbench is loaded, seven groups appear in the Preferences editor: [General](#General.md), [Display](#Display.md), [Workbenches](#Workbenches.md), [Python](#Python.md), [Addon Manager](#Addon_Manager.md), [Import-Export](#Import-Export.md) and [Measure](#Measure.md). Any workbenches that have been loaded, and have their own preferences, will appear below these.

Pressing the **Reset** button in the lower left corner of the Preferences dialog opens a menu (<small>(v1.0)</small> ) with options to reset preferences to their default values. You can reset the current page, the current group, or all preferences. In {{VersionMinus|0.21}} the button will reset **all** preferences.

Some advanced preferences can only be changed in the [Parameter editor](Std_DlgParameter.md). The [Fine-tuning](Fine-tuning.md) page lists some of them.

This page has been updated for version 1.0.

## General

This preferences group has seven pages: General, Document, Selection, Cache, Notification Area, Report view and Help.

In {{VersionMinus|0.21}} the seventh page, Help, is only available if the [Help Addon](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-Help) has been [installed](Std_AddonMgr.md).

A VBO is an [OpenGL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL) feature that provides methods for uploading vertex data (position, normal vector, color, etc.) to the graphics card. VBOs offer substantial performance gains because the data resides in the graphics memory rather than the system memory and so it can be rendered directly by the GPU.

|               | The preview shows the XY plane and a sphere, indicating the light source, connected by a line to a cone, indicating the direction. All elements in the preview, the sphere, the small cone directly attached to it, the line and the large cone, can be dragged to change the direction of the light. For more precision the direction vector can be set by specifying the **x**, **y** and **z** values or the **q0** - **q3** [quaternion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion) values. You can zoom the preview in and out with the buttons in the lower left corner. |
