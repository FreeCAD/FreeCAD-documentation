**(January 2021) 
The active development of CadQuery has moved away from FreeCAD [https://github.com/CadQuery/cadquery#why-this-fork], offering now a stand-alone GUI with the CQ-editor [https://github.com/CadQuery/CQ-editor].
The CadQuery workbench is '''no longer actively maintained''', but may receive sporadic fixes by its author.

## Latest CadQuery 

The latest version of CadQuery is no longer using FreeCAD and is not compatible with the CadQuery workbench. If you are interested in the latest version have a look at the [CadQuery Python module](https://github.com/CadQuery/cadquery) and the [CadQuery graphical editor](https://github.com/CadQuery/CQ-editor).
