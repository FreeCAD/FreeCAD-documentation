{{term|Topological Naming}}


{{defn|defn=A scheme whereby an edge or face, once created, is assigned a permanent name. Internally, FreeCAD identifies edges and faces on a solid by numbering them such as: Edge1, Edge2, Face1, Face2, etc. The problem is that these IDs are somewhat randomly applied, and they will change after something is done to the model that changes the amount of edges and faces. For example, if the model is revised an item linked to a Face2 could later erroneously become linked to a different face (which was renamed to become the new Face2), causing the user unwanted results.  As of the FreeCAD 0.20 release Topological Naming has not yet been implemented, and so if an object is modified such that the number of edges or faces changes, the names of the edges or faces of that object might change too.}}


{{term|Torus}}


{{defn|defn=A primitive shape.}}


{{term|Tracker}}


{{defn|defn=Short for bug tracker, the online software application used to keep track of reported bugs or feature requests. See also [Mantis](#Mantis.md).}}


{{term|Tree view|content=[Tree view](Tree_view.md)}}


{{defn|defn=The Tree view is a component of the FreeCAD [interface](Interface.md). It can be shown as a separate [GUI](#GUI.md) element or as part of the [Combo View](Combo_View.md). It contains a representation of the document's structure.}}

## U

{{term|Union}}


{{defn|defn=A [Part](Part_Workbench.md) [workbench](#Workbench.md) tool that performs a [Boolean operation](#Boolean_Operation.md) on selected shapes.}}


{{term|Unstable}}


{{defn|defn=A nickname for a very recent version of the FreeCAD software. This version will contain many changes recently implemented by the developers. It does not typically fail or produce wrong results, but it has not completed testing.}}


{{term|Upgrade|content=[Upgrade](Draft_Upgrade.md)}}


{{defn|defn=A [Draft](Draft_Workbench.md) [workbench](#Workbench.md) tool.}}

## V


{{gloss}}


{{term|Vector}}


{{defn|defn=A magnitude with a direction. Often represented graphically as an arrow in 2 or 3 dimensions. For example, "fifty paces north", "9.8 m/s^2 down", and "(3,5,6) units in the x, y, z, direction, respectively" are all vectors. In FreeCAD, they are most often denoted as ordered pairs (x, y) or ordered triples (x, y, z).}}


{{term|Vertex}}


{{defn|defn=A lone [point](#Point.md) in space, or the corner of a [shape](#shape.md) where [edges](#Edge.md) meet. The open Cascade Technology defines it, as a zero dimensional [shape](#shape.md) corresponding to a point in geometry. See [https://dev.opencascade.org/doc/overview/html/occt__tutorial.html#OCCT_TUTORIAL_SUB2_3 OCCT Profile: Defining the topology]}}


{{term|Vertices}}


{{defn|defn=Plural of [Vertex](#Vertex.md)}}


{{term|Viewprovider}}


{{defn|defn=General interface for all visual stuff in FreeCAD. A ViewProvider generates and handles all around visualizing and presenting objects from the FreeCAD [App layer](#App.md) to the user. This class and its descendents have to be implemented for any object type in order to show them in the [3D view](#3D_view.md) and [Tree view](#Tree_view.md).}}

## W


{{gloss}}


{{term|WB}}


{{defn|defn=Short for [workbench](#Workbench.md).}}


{{term|Wire}}


{{defn|no=1|defn=A sequence of connected [edges](#Edge.md) by [vertices](#Vertex.md). The term wire is used in this sense mainly by [https://dev.opencascade.org/doc/overview/html/occt__tutorial.html#OCCT_TUTORIAL_SUB2_3 Open Cascade Technology] and therefore also inside of FreeCAD.}}


{{defn|no=2|defn=A [Draft](Draft_Workbench.md) [workbench](#Workbench.md) command that creates a parametric wire.}}


{{term|Workbench}}


{{defn|defn=Also called a module, each workbench groups a set of tools dedicated to a specific task.}}
