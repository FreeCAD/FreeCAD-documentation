## Forum

The first place you can ask for help is the [FreeCAD forum](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewforum.php?f=3). Please read [this post](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=2264) before asking any question. Remember that [important information](Important_information.md) about your system is necessary when asking for help.

There are different subforums for FreeCAD users and developers. Make sure you search the internet, and read through existing questions before you ask for help. There are subforums where you can discuss more specific topics, give your impressions of FreeCAD, discuss new ideas, etc. The forums are very active and you should get a reply very quickly.

## Wiki

If you need help or have questions related to a particular page of this wiki documentation, you can always leave ideas or comments on the \"discussion\" tab of each page. To upload files for Wiki please use [this page](https://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/Special:Upload).

## Internet Relay Chat (IRC) 

There is an [IRC \#freecad chat room on Freenode](irc://chat.freenode.net/freecad). \#openFOAM-IRC is also on Freenode.

## Reddit

If you are on Reddit you may use the [r/FreeCAD](https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeCAD/), or the [r/flossCAD](https://www.reddit.com/r/flossCAD/) using the FreeCAD flair. The r/flossCAD subreddit also has [a chatroom](https://s.reddit.com/channel/300896_dfacaa912e069e3d3f7e55e5cedfb25483d8d68a) where might be able to ask questions. There are also [r/ElmerFEM](https://www.reddit.com/r/ElmerFEM/), [r/openscad](https://www.reddit.com/r/openscad/), [r/LibreCAD/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LibreCAD/) [r/OpenFOAM](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenFOAM/), and [r/Modelica](https://www.reddit.com/r/Modelica/) subreddits.

## Telegram

If you are on Telegram you may use the [t.me/FreeCAD\_EN](https://t.me/FreeCAD_EN).

## Twitter and Mastodon 

You may also follow the [official Twitter account for FreeCAD](https://twitter.com/FreeCADNews) and/or [the developers](https://twitter.com/fsfarimani/lists/freecad). There is also [FreeCAD\'s official Mastodon account](https://fosstodon.org/@FreeCAD) which you may follow.

## Facebook

You may join the [FreeCAD\'s Facebook public group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/416491481766626)

## Discord

We have an [official dedicated FreeCAD Discord server](https://discord.gg/NpMefpXWFT) with a variety of channels for various sub-topics. There are also several third-party servers with FreeCAD-related discussion channels. The [Elmer FEM](https://discordapp.com/invite/NeZEBZn) server has a channel for seemingly every CAD, CAM, and CAE tool out there, whether open source or proprietary, and it has a fairly well-established \"freecad\" channel. The wide variety of channels and communities this server attracts means it can be good for having discussions with people in related communities. The [OpenFOAM](https://discordapp.com/invite/P9p9eHn) server has a \"freecad-salome-etc\" channel, where you might be able to find people more interested in the overlap between FreeCAD and computational fluid dynamics tools like OpenFOAM. The [Modelica Language](https://discordapp.com/invite/bp2yeYU) server also has a \"freecad\" channel if you are interested in FreeCAD from a multi-domain modeling perspective. However, please do not use chat groups as the main medium of exchanging data. They are not indexed by the search engines and information produced on these platforms is not properly accumulated, as it is on forums, blog posts, or wiki pages.
