# Draft Split/pl

## Description

The <img alt="" src=images/Draft_Split.svg  style="width:24px;"> **Draft Split** command splits a [Draft Line](Draft_Line.md) or [Draft Wire](Draft_Wire.md) at a specified point or edge. This command is the counterpart of the [Draft Join](Draft_Join.md) command.

## Usage

1.  There are several ways to invoke the command:
    -   Press the **<img src="images/Draft_Split.svg" width=16px> [Draft Split](Draft_Split.md)** button.
    -   Select the **Modification â†’ <img src="images/Draft_Split.svg" width=16px> Split** option from the menu.
    -   Use the keyboard shortcut: **S** then **P**.
2.  Move the pointer over the correct edge of a [Draft Line](Draft_Line.md) or [Draft Wire](Draft_Wire.md).
3.  The edge is highlighted.
4.  Do one of the following:
    -   If the wire is closed:
        -   Pick any point on the edge.
        -   The edge is detached from the wire and becomes a separate wire.
    -   If the wire is open:
        -   Pick the correct point on the edge. See [Notes](#Notes.md).
        -   The wire is split at the picked point.

## Notes

-   If an open wire is split and the clicked point does not lie exactly on the selected edge, the new point will not be collinear with that former edge. Use an appropriate [Draft Snap](Draft_Snap.md) option to prevent this.
-   To split objects that are not [Draft Lines](Draft_Line.md) or [Draft Wires](Draft_Wire.md) you can try using [Draft Upgrade](Draft_Upgrade.md) and/or [Draft Downgrade](Draft_Downgrade.md) on them one or more times first.

## Scripting

See also: [Autogenerated API documentation](https://freecad.github.io/SourceDoc/) and [FreeCAD Scripting Basics](FreeCAD_Scripting_Basics.md).

To split a wire use the `split` method of the Draft module. This method returns `None`.


```python
split(wire, newPoint, edgeIndex)
```

-    `wire`the wire object to be split.

-    `newPoint`the point where the split should occur.

-    `edgeIndex`index of the edge where the split should occur (1-based).

Example:


```python
import FreeCAD as App
import Draft

doc = App.newDocument()

p1 = App.Vector(0, 0, 0)
p2 = App.Vector(500, 0, 0)
p3 = App.Vector(250, 0, 0)

wire = Draft.make_wire([p1, p2])

Draft.split(wire, p3, 1)
doc.recompute()
```
