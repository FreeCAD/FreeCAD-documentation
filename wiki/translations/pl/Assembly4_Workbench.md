## Introduction


{{TOCright}}

[Assembly4](Assembly4_Workbench.md) is an [external workbench](external_workbenches.md) that is used to perform assembly of different bodies contained in a single file or in multiple documents. It was created in the v0.19 development cycle to take advantage of Assembly3 branch\'s new features, such as the [App Link](App_Link.md) object, and the new [expression engine](expressions.md).

It was developed with the idea that a true constraint solver was not needed, and instead the [expression engine](expressions.md) was enough to establish relationships between different local coordinate systems attached to bodies. Thus its prototype name was \"Assembly without solver\" or AWS.

## Installation

Assembly4 can be installed from the [Addon Manager](Std_AddonMgr.md).

## Compatibility

Assembly4 was developed from the new tools created for [Assembly3](Assembly3_Workbench.md), in particular, the [App Link](App_Link.md) object and the improved [expression engine](expressions.md).

Assembly4 was inspired by <img alt="" src=images/A2p_workbench.svg  style="width:24px;"> [A2plus](A2plus_Workbench.md) and <img alt="" src=images/Assembly3_workbench_icon.svg  style="width:24px;"> [Assembly3](Assembly3_Workbench.md) but it is not compatible with them. If you have older models made in those two workbenches, you should use those workbenches to open your models only.
