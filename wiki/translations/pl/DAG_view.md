# DAG view/pl
## Wprowadzenie




The [DAG view](DAG_view.md) is a [directed acyclic graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) (DAG) that shows the relationships between different objects in the document. It is meant primarily to show how certain objects depend on others in a complex model with many features and references, such as those that can be created with the <img alt="" src=images/Workbench_PartDesign.svg  style="width:24px;"> [PartDesign Workbench](PartDesign_Workbench.md).

The DAG view resembles the graph that can be produced from a Git repository and its branches. Together with the standard [tree view](tree_view.md) and the [dependency graph](Std_DependencyGraph.md), the DAG view is a tool to inspect the parametric history of objects in a document.

## Przykład

A simple model will be seen with different views.

## Activating the DAG view 

The DAG view was introduced in 0.17 as an experimental feature for power users and developers, so they could troubleshoot complex models; therefore, the DAG view is not available by default.

To use this view use the [parameter editor](Std_DlgParameter.md). Create the following subgroup if it doesn\'t exist

-    `BaseApp/Preferences/DockWindows/DAGView`
    

then add the parameter `Enabled` of type `Boolean`, and set it to `True`.

Restart FreeCAD and activate DAG view: **{{StdMenu|[View](Std_View_Menu.md)** → Panels → DAG view}}.

In the [parameter editor](Std_DlgParameter.md) you can also change some properties in the following subgroup

-    `BaseApp/Preferences/DAGView`
    

-   FontPointSize - Set size of text font and can help with readability with high DPI displays. Set to 0 for default font size.

-   SelectionMode
    -   0 - single click selects an item. Ctrl-click to add items to selection.
    -   1 - every click adds/removes item to selection.

-   Direction - the order in which items are displayed.
    -   1 - child on top, parent under it
    -   -1 - parent on top, children under it
