# PySide Advanced Examples/pl
## Introduction

The purpose of this page is to cover advanced level examples of the [PySide](PySide.md) GUI manager (there are accompanying pages [PySide Beginner Examples](PySide_Beginner_Examples.md) and [PySide Intermediate Examples](PySide_Intermediate_Examples.md)).

By using the PySide module from inside FreeCAD, you have full control over its interface. You can for example:

-   Add your own panels, widgets and toolbars
-   Add or hide elements to existing panels
-   Change, redirect or add connections between all those elements

## Create Reference to the Main Window 

If you want to work on the FreeCAD interface, the very first thing to do is create a reference to the FreeCAD main window:


```python
import sys
from PySide import QtGui ,QtCore 
app = QtGui.qApp
mw = FreeCADGui.getMainWindow()
```

## Browse the Children of the Main Window 

Then, you can for example browse through all the widgets of the interface:


```python
for child in mw.children():
   print('widget name = ', child.objectName(), ', widget type = ', child)
```

The widgets in a Qt interface are usually nested into \"container\" widgets, so the children of our main window can themselves contain other children. Depending on the widget type, there are a lot of things you can do. Check the API documentation to see what is possible.

## Add New Widget Manually 

Adding a new widget, for example a dockWidget (which can be placed in one of FreeCAD\'s side panels) is easy:


```python
myWidget = QtGui.QDockWidget()
mw.addDockWidget(QtCore.Qt.RightDockWidgetArea,myWidget)
```

You could then add stuff directly to your widget:


```python
myWidget.setObjectName("my Nice New Widget")
myWidget.resize(QtCore.QSize(300,100)) # sets size of the widget
label = QtGui.QLabel("Hello World", myWidget) # creates a label
label.setGeometry(QtCore.QRect(2,50,200,24))  # sets its size
label.setObjectName("myLabel") # sets its name, so it can be found by name
```

## Add New Widget by Creating UI Object 

But a preferred method is to create a UI object which will do all of the setup of your widget at once. The big advantage is that such an UI object can be [created graphically](Dialog_creation.md) with the Qt Designer program. A typical object generated by Qt Designer is like this:


```python
class myWidget_Ui(object):
  def setupUi(self, myWidget):
    myWidget.setObjectName("my Nice New Widget")
    myWidget.resize(QtCore.QSize(300,100).expandedTo(myWidget.minimumSizeHint())) # sets size of the widget

    self.label = QtGui.QLabel(myWidget) # creates a label
    self.label.setGeometry(QtCore.QRect(50,50,200,24)) # sets its size
    self.label.setObjectName("label") # sets its name, so it can be found by name

  def retranslateUi(self, draftToolbar): # built-in QT function that manages translations of widgets
    myWidget.setWindowTitle(QtGui.QApplication.translate("myWidget", "My Widget", None, QtGui.QApplication.UnicodeUTF8))
    self.label.setText(QtGui.QApplication.translate("myWidget", "Welcome to my new widget!", None, QtGui.QApplication.UnicodeUTF8))
```

To use it, you just need to apply it to your freshly created widget like this:


```python
app = QtGui.qApp
FCmw = app.activeWindow()
myNewFreeCADWidget = QtGui.QDockWidget() # create a new dckwidget
myNewFreeCADWidget.ui = myWidget_Ui() # load the Ui script
myNewFreeCADWidget.ui.setupUi(myNewFreeCADWidget) # setup the ui
FCmw.addDockWidget(QtCore.Qt.RightDockWidgetArea,myNewFreeCADWidget) # add the widget to the main window
```

## Loading the UI from a Qt Designer .ui File 

The key to loading a UI file successfully is to use the full path to the file. As an example, the [Addon Manager](Std_AddonMgr.md) does it like this:


```python
self.dialog = FreeCADGui.PySideUic.loadUi(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "AddonManager.ui"))
```
