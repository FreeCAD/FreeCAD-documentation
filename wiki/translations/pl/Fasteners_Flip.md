# Fasteners Flip/pl

## Description

The <img alt="" src=images/Fasteners_Flip.svg  style="width   *24px;"> **Fasteners Flip** command inverts the orientation of [attached fasteners](Fasteners_Workbench#Usage.md) by changing their **invert** property.

## Usage

1.  Select one or more attached fasteners. The selection may include unattached fasteners, but these will not be flipped. See [Notes](#Notes.md).
2.  There are several ways to invoke the command   *
    -   Press the **<img src="images/Fasteners_Flip.svg" width=16px> [Invert fastener](Fasteners_Flip.md)** button.
    -   Select the **Fasteners → <img src="images/Fasteners_Flip.svg" width=16px> Invert fastener** option from the menu.
3.  The orientation of the selected attached fasteners is inverted.

## Notes

-   The **invert** property is ignored for unattached fasteners and they cannot be flipped with this command. To flip them their **Placement** should be changed, for example with the <img alt="" src=images/Std_TransformManip.svg  style="width   *16px;"> [Std TransformManip](Std_TransformManip.md) command.
