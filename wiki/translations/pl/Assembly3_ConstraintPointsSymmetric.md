# Assembly3 ConstraintPointsSymmetric/pl

## Description

This tool builds a link between two or three objects of an assembly and positions two point elements symmetrically to a planar face element or a plane . The selected elements of each object or more precisely their implicit coordinate systems (ICS) are used to position the objects to each other.

Based on the planar element\'s ICS both point elements have identical x- and y-coordinates and the same z-offset in opposite directions.

## Usage

1.  Place two objects into an assembly
2.  Select two point elements of one object
3.  Select a planar element of the other object
4.  Press the **<img src="images/Assembly_ConstraintPointsSymmetric.svg" width=16px> [Points symmetric](Assembly3_ConstraintPointsSymmetric.md)** button.

Or

1.  Place three objects into an assembly
2.  Select one point element of the first two objects
3.  Select a planar element of the third object
4.  Press the **<img src="images/Assembly_ConstraintPointsSymmetric.svg" width=16px> [Points symmetric](Assembly3_ConstraintPointsSymmetric.md)** button.
