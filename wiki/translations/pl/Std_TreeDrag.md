# Std TreeDrag/pl

## Description

The **Std TreeDrag** command initiates a drag operation for selected objects in the [Tree view](Tree_view.md). This command is useful when the objects you want to drag and drop and the target container are not visible at the same time in the Tree view.

## Usage

1.  Select one or more objects.
2.  If required scroll the Tree view to reveal the target container.
3.  There are several ways to invoke the command:
    -   Click on the black down arrow to the right of the **<img src="images/Std_TreeSyncView.svg" width=16px>** button and select the **<img src="images/Std_TreeDrag.svg" width=16px> Initiate dragging** option from the flyout. Note: the button image will change depending on the selected option. This option does not work on the Windows OS.
    -   Select the **View → TreeView actions → <img src="images/Std_TreeDrag.svg" width=16px> Initiate dragging** option from the menu. This option does not work on the Windows OS.
    -   Use the keyboard shortcut: **T** then **D**. On the Windows OS it is important that the mouse is already over the target container when this shortcut is entered, and stays there for the next step.
4.  Left-click the target container.
