# Path SimpleCopy/pl

## Description

This tool creates a non-parametric copy of a given path.

## Usage

1.  Select one [Path](Path_Workbench.md) object
2.  Press the **<img src="images/Path_SimpleCopy.svg" width=16px> [Simple Copy](Path_SimpleCopy.md)** button

## Options

-   The simple copy is not bound anymore to the path that was used to make the copy, and is not parametric. Therefore, when edited with the [Path Inspect](Path_Inspect.md) tool, any change made to its G-code will be retained.
