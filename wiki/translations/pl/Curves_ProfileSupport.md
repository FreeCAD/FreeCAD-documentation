# Curves ProfileSupport/pl

## Description

## Usage

1.  Switch to the <img alt="" src=images/Curves_workbench_icon.svg  style="width:24px;"> [Curves](Curves_Workbench.md) workbench (install from <img alt="" src=images/Std_AddonMgr.svg  style="width:24px;"> [Addon Manager](Std_AddonMgr.md) is necessary, if not previously installed)
2.  To invoke the command, do one of the following:
    -   Press the <img alt="" src=images/Curves_ProfileSupport.svg  style="width:24px;"> button in the Curves toolbar.
    -   Use the **Surfaces → Profile support plane** entry in the dropdown menu.

## Notes
