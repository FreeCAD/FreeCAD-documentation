# Arch Equipment/pl

## Description

The Equipment tool offers you a simple and convenient way to insert non-structural, standalone elements such as pieces of furniture, hidro-sanitary equipments or electrical appliances to your projects. Equipments are based on [Part shapes](Part_Workbench.md), which allow them to benefit from the solidity and possibilities of BRep geometry, and generate nice views when rendered to plan and section views.

*Furniture objects enclosed in an [Arch Equipment](Arch_Equipment.md) object. The flat projections can be obtained by the [Draft Shape2DView](Draft_Shape2DView.md) tool*

As of version 0.17, equipment objects also have a **HiRes** property where a [Mesh](Mesh_Workbench.md) object can be attached. Equipment objects can then be made to display that mesh in the 3D view instead of their shape, which allows to use any high-resolution mesh objects such as detailed pieces of furniture commonly found on websites.

When using the Arch OBJ exporter, all equipment objects that are in mesh display mode will be exported as their mesh instead of their shape.

## Usage

1.  Select a [Part](Part_Workbench.md) shape, and optionally a [Mesh](Mesh_Workbench.md) object.
2.  Press the **<img src="images/Arch_Equipment.svg" width=16px> [Arch Equipment](Arch_Equipment.md)** button, or press **E** then **Q** keys.

## Options

-   Equipments share the common properties and behaviours of all [Arch Components](Arch_Component.md)

## Properties

-    **Model**: A description of the model of this equipment.

-    **Url**: An URL of the product page where more information about this equipment can be found.

-    **Mesh**: A [Mesh](Mesh_Workbench.md) representation to use for this equipment. When set, the **Mesh** display mode becomes available.

## Scripting


**See also:**

[Arch API](Arch_API.md) and [FreeCAD Scripting Basics](FreeCAD_Scripting_Basics.md).

The Equipment tool can be used in [macros](Macros.md) and from the [Python](Python.md) console by using the following function: 
```python
Equipment = makeEquipment(baseobj=None, placement=None, name="Equipment")
```

-   Creates an `Equipment` object from the given `baseobj`, which can be a `Part` or a `Mesh`.
-   If a `placement` is given, it is used.
-   It returns `None` if the operation fails.

Example: 
```python
import FreeCAD, Arch

Box = FreeCAD.ActiveDocument.addObject("Part::Box", "Box")
Box.Length = 500
Box.Width = 2000
Box.Height = 600

Equip = Arch.makeEquipment(Box)
FreeCAD.ActiveDocument.recompute()
```
