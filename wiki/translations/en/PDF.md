## Description

[Portable Document Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF) (PDF) is a file format developed by Adobe in the 1990s to present documents, including text and images.

PDF is based on the PostScript language, which is a vector-based format to describe pages. In this sense it\'s similar to [SVG](SVG.md), as it allows scaling a drawing to any size without losing its shape or amount of details.

Nevertheless, a PDF can contain many things, including text, fonts, vector graphics, and [bitmap](bitmap.md) images. PDF was standardized as an open format in 2008, as ISO 32000.

PDF is commonly used as a sharing format, that is, to share documents, text, or images, that will display and print exactly as the author intended.

## Usage

As FreeCAD is based on the Qt graphical toolkit, it can export the [3D view](3D_view.md) natively to PDF. This can be useful to export carefully created drawings that other users don\'t need to modify. For example, pages created with the [TechDraw Workbench](TechDraw_Workbench.md) can be [exported](Std_Export.md) in this way for sharing or printing. In many cases it is also possible to perform two way conversion between PDF and [SVG](SVG.md).

The option to export to PDF is available in the **File → [Export PDF](Std_Export.md)** menu.
