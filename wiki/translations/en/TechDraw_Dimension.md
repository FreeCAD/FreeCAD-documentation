# TechDraw Dimension/en

## Description

The **TechDraw Dimension** tool is the TechDraw equivalent of the [Sketcher Dimension](Sketcher_Dimension.md) tool. It offers contextual dimensioning and thus can replace most of the other [dimension tools](TechDraw_Workbench#Dimensions.md).

## Usage

1.  Optionally preselect some geometric elements (vertices, edges or faces).
2.  There are several ways to invoke the tool:
    -   Press the **<img src="images/TechDraw_Dimension.svg" width=16px> [Insert Dimension](TechDraw_Dimension.md)** button.
    -   Select the **TechDraw → Dimensions → <img src="images/TechDraw_Dimension.svg" width=16px> Insert Dimension** option from the menu.
    -   Use the keyboard shortcut: **D**.
3.  The cursor changes to a cross with the tool icon.
4.  If you have not yet selected an element: select one.
5.  Depending on the selected element(s) a dimension is proposed.
6.  Optionally select an additional element.
7.  The proposed dimension is updated.
8.  Optionally press the **M** key one or more times to cycle through other available dimensions, if any.
9.  Do one of the following:
    -   Click in an empty area of the page or within the view to confirm:
        1.  The clicked point determines the location of the dimension.
        2.  A dimension is added.
        3.  This tool runs in continue mode: optionally keep creating dimensions.
    -   To finish, right-click or press **Esc**.

## Limitations

-   Currently the tool can only handle 2D references (geometry selected in the drawing).
