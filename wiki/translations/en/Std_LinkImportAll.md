# Std LinkImportAll/en

## Description


**[<img src=images/Std_LinkImportAll.svg style="width:16px"> [Std LinkImportAll](Std_LinkImportAll.md)**

imports all **Linked Object**s from Links into the current document, and then changes the attachment to point to these imported objects.

This command essentially runs **[<img src=images/Std_LinkImport.svg style="width:16px"> [Std LinkImport](Std_LinkImport.md)** for all Links in a document.

## Usage

1.  Make sure you have a \"source\" document with original objects, and a second \"target\" document with Links to those objects.
2.  Open the target document and press **[<img src=images/Std_LinkImportAll.svg style="width:16px"> [Import all links](Std_LinkImportAll.md)**.

*Left: various Links that point to objects in the "source" document. Right: the original objects were imported (copied) into the "target" document, and the existing Links were changed to point to these copies, so they no longer point to objects in "source".*
