- GuiCommand:   Name:Drawing Landscape A3   Workbenches:[[Drawing Workbench   Drawing]], Complete|MenuLocation:Drawing - Insert new drawing - A3 Landscape   Shortcut:none---

This tool creates a new drawing sheet from already installed templates. Currently, even though the menu and the toolbar allow for A0 to A4 landscape formats, only an A3 Landscape template is available.

A **Page** object will be added to the Project tree, taking the form of a folder icon. Views that will be created afterward will be placed underneath this folder.

To open the Drawing viewer to display the page, simply double-click on the **Page** object, or right-click → Show drawing. The page will be opened in a new tab. You can close the tab and open it again at any time the same way.

If the page does not display, click on the <img alt="" src=images/view-refresh.png  style="width:16px;"> refresh icon in the main toolbar, or go to *Edit → Refresh* menu, or shortcut **CTRL+R**.

<img alt="" src=images/Drawing_Page.png  style="width:500px;">

### Options

-   The template used by a Page can be changed through its Template property in Data view. Click on the value field, then on the \"\...\" button and navigate to a [suitable template](Drawing_templates.md). Then refresh the view.
