## Description

This WorkBench lets you know the volume information surface area, center of mass and moment of intertia of the selected object.

<img alt="" src=images/ObjectInfoIt.png  style="width:480px;">

## Installation

If you\'re on Linux, you need to create a folder named \"Mod\" in the .FreeCAD hidden folder which is located in your Home folder. Then create a folder named \"Info\" in the \"Mod\" folder, and extract the content of the archive in it. On Windows, I have no idea where that would be. Use the same procedure to Windows in C:\\Program Files\\FreeCAD\\Mod.

## Usage

Then start FreeCAD, open your STEP file and switch to the \"Info\" workbench with the workbench switcher or by going to the View → Workbench menu. Now select your solid, and click on the \"Info\" icon; the left taskbar will show some information on the model, including volume, surface area, center of mass and moment of intertia.

## Code
