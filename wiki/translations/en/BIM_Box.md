## Description

<img alt="" src=images/BIM_box_screenshot.png  style="width:1024px;">

The BIM Box tool allows you to create a standard [Part Box](Part_Box.md), but instead of creating the object and letting you specify its dimensions and position afterwards, like the original [Part Workbench](Part_Workbench.md) tool does, this tool allows you to place and define the box dimensions graphically when creating the object. Boxes are basic [cuboid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuboid) shapes, that can be used as a base of any other kind of BIM object later on.

## Usage

1.  Press the **<img src="images/BIM_Box.png" width=16px> [BIM Box](BIM_Box.md)** button
2.  Click a first point to define a first corner of the box. It can be any of the box corners
3.  Click a second point to define a first edge of the box, starting from the first point
4.  Click a third point to define a first face of the box, orthogonal to the first edge
5.  Click a fourth point to define the extrusion distance of the first face, forming the final box
