# Draft Mirror/en

## Description

The <img alt="" src=images/Draft_Mirror.svg  style="width:24px;"> **Draft Mirror** command creates mirrored copies, [Part Mirror](Part_Mirror.md) objects, from selected objects. A [Part Mirror](Part_Mirror.md) object is parametric, it will update if its source object changes.

The command can be used on 2D objects created with the [Draft Workbench](Draft_Workbench.md) or [Sketcher Workbench](Sketcher_Workbench.md), but also on many 3D objects such as those created with the [Part Workbench](Part_Workbench.md), [PartDesign Workbench](PartDesign_Workbench.md) or [Arch Workbench](Arch_Workbench.md).

## Usage

See also: [Draft Snap](Draft_Snap.md) and [Draft Constrain](Draft_Constrain.md).

1.  Optionally select one or more objects.
2.  There are several ways to invoke the command:
    -   Press the **<img src="images/Draft_Mirror.svg" width=16px> [Draft Mirror](Draft_Mirror.md)** button.
    -   Select the **Modification → <img src="images/Draft_Mirror.svg" width=16px> Mirror** option from the menu.
    -   Use the keyboard shortcut: **M** then **I**.
3.  If you have not yet selected an object: select an object in the [3D view](3D_view.md).
4.  The **Mirror** task panel opens. See [Options](#Options.md) for more information.
5.  Pick the first point of the mirror plane in the [3D view](3D_view.md), or type coordinates and press the **<img src="images/Draft_AddPoint.svg" width=16px> Enter point** button.
6.  Pick the second point of the mirror plane in the [3D view](3D_view.md), or type coordinates and press the **<img src="images/Draft_AddPoint.svg" width=16px> Enter point** button.
7.  The mirror plane is defined by the selected points and the normal of the [Draft working plane](Draft_SelectPlane.md).

## Options

The single character keyboard shortcuts mentioned here can be changed. See [Draft Preferences](Draft_Preferences.md).

-   To manually enter coordinates enter the X, Y and Z component, and press **Enter** after each. Or you can press the **<img src="images/Draft_AddPoint.svg" width=16px> Enter point** button when you have the desired values. It is advisable to move the pointer out of the [3D view](3D_view.md) before entering coordinates.
-   Press **R** or click the **Relative** checkbox to toggle relative mode. If relative mode is on, the coordinates of the second point are relative to the first point, else they are relative to the coordinate system origin.
-   Press **G** or click the **Global** checkbox to toggle global mode. If global mode is on, coordinates are relative to the global coordinate system, else they are relative to the [working plane](Draft_SelectPlane.md) coordinate system. <small>(v0.20)</small> 
-   Press **S** to switch [Draft snapping](Draft_Snap.md) on or off.
-   Press **Esc** or the **Close** button to abort the command.

## Notes

-   Mirrored copies of [Draft Lines](Draft_Line.md), [Draft Wires](Draft_Wire.md), [Draft Arcs](Draft_Arc.md) and [Draft Circles](Draft_Circle.md) can be turned into independent editable Draft objects by using [Draft Downgrade](Draft_Downgrade.md) and then [Draft Upgrade](Draft_Upgrade.md).
-   The [Part SimpleCopy](Part_SimpleCopy.md) command can be used to create a copy of a mirrored object that is not linked to its source object.

## Preferences

See also: [Preferences Editor](Preferences_Editor.md) and [Draft Preferences](Draft_Preferences.md).

-   To change the number of decimals used for the input of coordinates: **Edit → Preferences... → General → Units → Units settings → Number of decimals**.

## Properties

See also: [Property editor](property_editor.md).

A [Part Mirror](Part_Mirror.md) object is derived from a [Part Feature](Part_Feature.md) object and inherits all its properties. It also has the following additional properties:

### Data


{{TitleProperty|Base}}

-    **Source|Link**: specifies the object that is mirrored.


{{TitleProperty|Plane}}

-    **Base|Vector**: specifies the base point of the mirror plane.

-    **Normal|Vector**: specifies the normal direction of the mirror plane.

## Scripting

See also: [Autogenerated API documentation](https://freecad.github.io/SourceDoc/) and [FreeCAD Scripting Basics](FreeCAD_Scripting_Basics.md).

To mirror objects use the `mirror` method of the Draft module.


```python
mirrored_list = mirror(objlist, p1, p2)
```

-    `objlist`contains the objects to be mirrored. It is either a single object or a list of objects.

-    `p1`is the first point of the mirror plane.

-    `p2`is the second point of the mirror plane.

-   If the [Draft working plane](Draft_SelectPlane.md) is available the alignment of the mirror plane is determined by its normal, else the view direction of the camera in the active [3D view](3D_view.md) is used. If the graphical interface is not available the Z axis is used.

-    `mirrored_list`is returned with the new `Part::Mirroring` objects. It is either a single object or a list of objects, depending on `objlist`.

Example:


```python
import FreeCAD as App
import Draft

doc = App.newDocument()

place = App.Placement(FreeCAD.Vector(1000, 0, 0), App.Rotation())
polygon1 = Draft.make_polygon(3, 750)
polygon2 = Draft.make_polygon(5, 750, placement=place)

p1 = App.Vector(2000, -1000, 0)
p2 = App.Vector(2000, 1000, 0)

line1 = Draft.make_line(p1, p2)
mirrored1 = Draft.mirror(polygon1, p1, p2)

Line2 = Draft.make_line(-p1, -p2)
mirrored2 = Draft.mirror([polygon1, polygon2], -p1, -p2)

doc.recompute()
```
