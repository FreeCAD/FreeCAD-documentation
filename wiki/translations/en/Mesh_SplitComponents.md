# Mesh SplitComponents/en

## Description

The **Mesh SplitComponents** command splits a mesh object into its components. A mesh component is a complete group of connected faces. For each component a new non-parametric mesh object, a [Mesh Feature](Mesh_Feature.md), is created. If the original mesh object contains only one component, and this is usually the case, a single new mesh object, effectively a copy, is created. This command is the counterpart of the [Mesh Merge](Mesh_Merge.md) command.

## Usage

1.  Select a single mesh object.
2.  There are several ways to invoke the command:
    -   Press the **<img src="images/Mesh_SplitComponents.svg" width=16px> [Split by components](Mesh_SplitComponents.md)** button.
    -   Select the **Meshes → <img src="images/Mesh_SplitComponents.svg" width=16px> Split by components** option from the menu.

## Properties

See: [Mesh Feature](Mesh_Feature.md).
