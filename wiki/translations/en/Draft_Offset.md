# Draft Offset/en

## Description

The <img alt="" src=images/Draft_Offset.svg  style="width   *24px;"> **Draft Offset** command offsets each segment of a selected object over a given distance, or creates an offset copy of the selected object.

*Offsetting a Draft Wire*

## Usage

See also   * [Draft Snap](Draft_Snap.md) and [Draft Constrain](Draft_Constrain.md).

1.  Optionally select one object. The object must lie on the current [Draft working plane](Draft_SelectPlane.md).
2.  There are several ways to invoke the command   *
    -   Press the **<img src="images/Draft_Offset.svg" width=16px> [Draft Offset](Draft_Offset.md)** button.
    -   Select the **Modification → <img src="images/Draft_Offset.svg" width=16px> Offset** option from the menu.
    -   Use the keyboard shortcut   * **O** then **S**.
3.  If you have not yet selected an object   * select an object in the [3D view](3D_view.md).
4.  The **Offset** task panel opens. See [Options](#Options.md) for more information.
5.  To define the offset distance do one of the following   *
    -   Pick a point in the [3D view](3D_view.md).
    -   Enter a numerical value   *
        1.  Make sure the pointer is on the correct side of the object in the [3D view](3D_view.md).
        2.  Do not move the pointer out of the [3D view](3D_view.md).
        3.  Enter a **Distance**.
        4.  Press **Enter** to finish the command.

## Options

The single character keyboard shortcuts and the modifier keys mentioned here can be changed. See [Draft Preferences](Draft_Preferences.md).

-   If the **OCC-style offset** checkbox is checked a special offset style is used   * open [Draft Wires](Draft_Wire.md) are offset on both sides, and new edges are connected with rounded corners. This only works for planar Draft objects with at least two straight edges. Note that with this style a new non-parametric object is created, and if copy mode is off the original object is deleted.
-   Press **P** or click the **Copy** checkbox to toggle copy mode. If copy mode is on, the command will create an offset copy instead of offsetting the original object.
-   Holding down **Alt** before picking points in the [3D view](3D_view.md) will also toggle copy mode. While **Alt** is held down multiple offset points can be picked. Release **Alt** to finish the command and see the created copies.
-   Hold down **Shift** to keep the offset distance linked to the current segment.
-   Press **S** to switch [Draft snapping](Draft_Snap.md) on or off.
-   Press **Esc** or the **Close** button to abort the command.

## Notes

-   To create an offset version of a [Draft BSpline](Draft_BSpline.md) its points are offset individually, and from the new points a new spline is calculated. This new spline is not parallel to the original spline. For an exact parallel offset of a [Draft BSpline](Draft_BSpline.md) the [Part Offset2D](Part_Offset2D.md) command should be used.
-   The Draft Offset command cannot handle [Draft BezCurves](Draft_BezCurve.md). Use the [Part Offset2D](Part_Offset2D.md) command instead.

## Preferences

See also   * [Preferences Editor](Preferences_Editor.md) and [Draft Preferences](Draft_Preferences.md).

-   To change the number of decimals used for the input of the distance   * **Edit → Preferences... → General → Units → Units settings → Number of decimals**.

## Scripting

See also   * [Autogenerated API documentation](https   *//freecad.github.io/SourceDoc/) and [FreeCAD Scripting Basics](FreeCAD_Scripting_Basics.md).

To offset objects use the `offset` method of the Draft module. The method can only handle [Draft Wires](Draft_Wire.md), [Draft Circles](Draft_Circle.md), [Draft Rectangles](Draft_Rectangle.md), [Draft Polygons](Draft_Polygon.md) and [Draft BSplines](Draft_BSpline.md).


```python
offset_obj = offset(obj, delta, copy=False, bind=False, sym=False, occ=False)
```

-    `obj`is the object to be offset.

-    `delta`contains the offset information   *

    -   For [Draft Wires](Draft_Wire.md), [Draft Rectangles](Draft_Rectangle.md) and [Draft Polygons](Draft_Polygon.md) it is an offset vector that must be perpendicular to the first segment of the object.
    -   For [Draft Circles](Draft_Circle.md) it is the new radius.
    -   For [Draft BSplines](Draft_BSpline.md) it is a list of new points.

-   If `copy` is `True` the original object is kept and a new object is created.

-   If `bind` is `True` a face is created by connecting the shape of the original object and the shape of its offset. This only works for open [Draft Wires](Draft_Wire.md).

-   If `sym` is `True`, and `bind` is `True` as well, the offset is made on both sides of the original object, the total width being the length of the given vector. This only works for open [Draft Wires](Draft_Wire.md).

-   If `occ` is `True` OCC-style offsetting is used. See [Options](#Options.md). If `occ` is `True` the `bind` and `sym` arguments are ignored.

-    `offset_obj`is returned with the original offset object, or with the new object. If `bind` is `True` or `occ` is `True`, the new object is a `[Part   *   *Feature](Part_Feature.md)` object.

Example   *


```python
import FreeCAD as App
import Draft

doc = App.newDocument()

p1 = App.Vector(0, 0, 0)
p2 = App.Vector(1500, 2000, 0)
p3 = App.Vector(4000, 0, 0)

wire = Draft.make_wire([p1, p2, p3])
doc.recompute()

vector = App.Vector(-200, 150, 0)
offset1 = Draft.offset(wire, vector, copy=True, bind=True, sym=True)
offset2 = Draft.offset(wire, 3*vector, copy=True)
offset3 = Draft.offset(wire, 6*vector, copy=True)
offset4 = Draft.offset(wire, 9*vector, copy=True)
offset5 = Draft.offset(wire, 1.5*vector, copy=True, occ=True)

doc.recompute()
```
