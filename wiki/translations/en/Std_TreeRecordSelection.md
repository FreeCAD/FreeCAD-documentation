## Description

The **Std TreeRecordSelection** command toggles the [Tree view](Tree_view.md) RecordSelection mode. If this mode is on, each Tree view selection is stored for future use. With the **<img src="images/Std_SelBack.svg" width=16px>** and **<img src="images/Std_SelForward.svg" width=16px>** buttons you can go backwards and forwards through these selections and restore them.

## Usage

1.  There are several ways to invoke the command:
    -   Click on the black down arrow to the right of the **<img src="images/Std_TreeSyncView.svg" width=16px>** button and select the **Record selection** option from the flyout. Note: the button image will change depending on the selected option.
    -   Select the **View → TreeView actions → Record selection** option from the menu.
    -   Use the keyboard shortcut: **T** then **5**.

## Preferences

See also: [Preferences Editor](Preferences_Editor.md).

The Tree view RecordSelection mode can also be set in the preferences: **Edit→ Preferences → General → Selection → Record selection in tree view in order to go back/forward using navigation button**.
