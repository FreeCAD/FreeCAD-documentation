The difference between the regular version and the version \"Ubuntu\" in another type of encoding of the characters above + 128 with the procedure
PS: this version is derived from the original version, the difference is located at the level of encoding **² ³ ° µ** characters that can cause the error \"ordinal not in range (128)\" on some configurations ?

Example : 
```python
global uniteSs       ; uniteSs       = u"mm²"
global uniteVs       ; uniteVs       = u"mm³"
global uniteAs       ; uniteAs       = u"°"
``` replace to : 
```python
global uniteSs       ; uniteSs       = "mm"+iso8859(unichr(178))
global uniteVs       ; uniteVs       = "mm"+iso8859(unichr(179))
global uniteAs       ; uniteAs       = iso8859(unichr(176))
```

Files saved with this macro are incompatible with the files of the other versions.

Both versions can operate independently of the OS used.
