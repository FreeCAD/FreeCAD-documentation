# Civil Engineering Workbench/en
## Description

Civil Engineering is a broad category of engineering and covers several subjects, primarily environmental (wastewater), geotechnical, transportation, and structural. At present, the primary focus of the civil engineering effort in FreeCAD is focused on transportation engineering, or more specifically 3D Highway design.

At present, only two components of civil engineering are represented in FreeCAD:

1.  [Rebar Workbench](Arch_Rebar.md)
2.  [Transportation Workbench](Transportation_Workbench.md)

The Rebar tools are currently part of the [Arch Workbench](Arch_Workbench.md)
