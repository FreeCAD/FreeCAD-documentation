# Sketcher CreateRegularPolygon/en

## Description

Draws a regular polygon inscribed in a construction geometry circle. When starting the tool, a box apears asking for the number of sides of the regular polygon. Once the **OK** button is pressed the mouse pointer changes to a white cross with a red hexagon icon. The coordinates of the pointer are shown beside it in blue in real time.

## Usage

1.  After pressing the **[<img src=images/Sketcher_CreateRegularPolygon.svg style="width:16px"> [Create regular polygon](Sketcher_CreateRegularPolygon.md)** button, define the number of sides of the polygon in the pop up box and confirm by pressing the **OK** button.
2.  Click once to set the center, then move the mouse and click a second time to set one of the vertices.
3.  Pressing **Esc** or clicking the right mouse button cancels the function.

## Notes

The circumscribed circle is construction geometry, which is only visible when editing the sketch.
