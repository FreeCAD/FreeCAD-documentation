## Description

Sometimes when a user applies changes to the model, FreeCAD does not seem to recognize/integrate them. In addition to that, the blue **<img src="images/Std_Refresh.svg" width=24px> [Refresh/Recompute](Std_Refresh.md)** button remains greyed out. Hence this small macro was designed to force a manual recompute of the model.

**Note:** As of <small>(v0.17)</small>  the effect of this macro can be achieved through the GUI. Right-click project in [model tree view](Tree_view.md), and pick **Mark to recompute** from the context menu. What this does is make the Refresh/Recompute icon active again. Now press on the <img alt="" src=images/Std_Refresh.svg  style="width:24px;"> [Refresh/Recompute](Std_Refresh.md) button to trigger a recompute.

## Usage

Run the macro when necessary.
