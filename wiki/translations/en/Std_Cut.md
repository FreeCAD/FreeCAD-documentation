# Std Cut/en

## Description

The **Std Cut** command is limited: it can only be used for [spreadsheet cells](Spreadsheet_Workbench.md). The command copies the contents and properties of cells to the Clipboard and then clears them.

To cut other objects you can use the [Std Copy](Std_Copy.md) command followed by a delete operation.

## Usage

1.  Select one or more cells in the spreadsheet.
2.  There are several ways to invoke the command:
    -   Press the **<img src="images/Std_Cut.svg" width=16px> [Cut](Std_Cut.md)** button.
    -   Select the **Edit → <img src="images/Std_Cut.svg" width=16px> Cut** option from the menu.

## Notes

-   The standard keyboard shortcut **Ctrl**+**X** does not call this command but uses the Cut function from the OS instead. You can use this shortcut in most FreeCAD text windows and input boxes, it also works for spreadsheet cells.
