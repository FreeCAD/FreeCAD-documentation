# Arch DAE/en
The _ can import meshes from .dae files, and export Arch and other [Shape](Part_Workbench.md)-based objects to the .dae format.

Note that imported objects will be [Mesh](Mesh_Workbench.md) objects, and will need to be turned into [Shapes](Shape.md) or Arch objects for optimal use. The [Arch Workbench](Arch_Workbench.md) has several tools to help you in performing that operation.

The Collada import functionality in the Arch workbench depends on [pycollada](http://pycollada.github.io/). If it is not installed on your system, Collada import/export will be disabled.
