Vectors are used everywhere in FreeCAD.

Example: 
```python
v=FreeCAD.Vector()
v=FreeCAD.Vector(1,0,0)
v=FreeCAD.Base.Vector()
v2 = FreeCAD.Vector(3,2,-5)
v3 = v.add(v2)
print v3.Length
```


{{APIProperty|Length|returns the length of the vector.}}


{{APIFunction|add|Vector|adds another vector to this one.|vector}}


{{APIFunction|cross|Vector|the crossproduct between this vector and another.|vector}}


{{APIFunction|distanceToLine|Vector1,Vector2|the distance between the vector and a line through Vector1 in direction Vector2.|float}}


{{APIFunction|distanceToLineSegment|Vector1,Vector2|a vector to the closest point on a line segment from Vector1 to Vector2.|vector}}


{{APIFunction|distanceToPlane|Vector1,Vector2|the distance between the vector and a plane defined by a point and a normal.|float}}


{{APIFunction|dot|Vector|the dot product between 2 vectors.|float}}


{{APIFunction|getAngle|Vector|the angle in radians between this vector and another.|float}}


{{APIFunction|multiply|Float|multiplies (uniform scale) a vector by the given factor.|nothing}}


{{APIFunction|normalize| |normalizes a vector (sets its length to 1.0).|nothing}}


{{APIFunction|projectToLine|Vector1,Vector2|projects the vector on a line through Vector1 in direction  Vector2.|nothing}}


{{APIFunction|projectToPlane|Vector1,Vector2|projects the vector on a plane defined by a point (Vector1) and a normal (Vector2).|nothing}}


{{APIFunction|scale|Float,Float,Float|Same as multiply but lets specify different values for x, y and z directions. (non-uniform scale)|nothing}}


{{APIFunction|sub|Vector|subtracts another vector from this one.|vector}}


{{APIProperty|x|the x coordinate of a vector.}}


{{APIProperty|y|the y coordinate of a vector.}}


{{APIProperty|z|the z coordinate of a vector.}}
