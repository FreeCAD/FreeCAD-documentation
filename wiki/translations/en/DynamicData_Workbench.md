## Overview

DynamicData is an [external workbench](External_workbenches.md) with which one can create a container object for holding custom properties.

With this workbench it\'s possible to create a new custom [property](property.md) of just about any type that FreeCAD supports. For example a Length property or a [Placement](Placement.md) property. These custom properties can then be used in [Expressions](Expressions.md) just like any other property. For example, you could create a Length property called \"Width\" and refer to it when constraining a sketch element. Then when the \"Width\" property is changed, the sketch constraint will automatically update. This is similar to the way one can use a spreadsheet, but is more interactive in that the properties can be changed while still being able to see the [3D view](3D_view.md) and also allows for a wider variety of property types.

Some features include:

-   ability to import named constraints from a sketch
-   ability to copy properties or set property values from one object to another
-   container objects remain compatible with FreeCAD installations that do not have the workbench installed

## Installation

This workbench can be installed from the [Addon Manager](Std_AddonMgr.md). For manual installation see [Installing more workbenches](Installing_more_workbenches.md).

## External workbenches 

FreeCAD workbenches are easy to program in [Python](Python.md), there are therefore many people developing additional workbenches outside of the FreeCAD main developers.

The [external workbenches](external_workbenches.md) page has some information and tutorials on some of them, and the [FreeCAD Addons](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-addons) project aims at gathering them and making them easily installable from within FreeCAD.

New workbenches are in development, stay tuned!
