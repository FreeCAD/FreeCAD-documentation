## Post-Import 

After import the model is (for FreeCAD), just an assembly of faces. You might want to convert the model into a shape FreeCAD can recognize and that could be altered in FreeCAD.

To do this:

1.  Switch to the <img alt="" src=images/Workbench_Part.svg  style="width:24px;"> [Part Workbench](Part_Workbench.md)
2.  Select the mesh, and go to the **Part → [Create shape from mesh](Part_ShapeFromMesh.md)** or press the <img alt="" src=images/Part_ShapeFromMesh.svg  style="width:24px;"> [Part ShapeFromMesh](Part_ShapeFromMesh.md) button
3.  Click **OK** in the dialog
4.  Select the newly created shape
5.  Go to **Part → [Convert to solid](Part_MakeSolid.md)**
6.  Select the newly created solid
7.  Go to **Part → [Refine shape](Part_RefineShape.md)** or press the <img alt="" src=images/Part_RefineShape.svg  style="width:24px;"> [Part RefineShape](Part_RefineShape.md) button

**Note:** The last step is not necessary, but it will clean the solid of most of its residual edges on planar and cylindrical surfaces.

## Errors

### \"cannot convert because shape is not a shell\" 

Well, your shell seems to have errors, maybe it is not closed (has holes). Since the capabilities of the mesh workbench in FreeCAD are a little limited at the moment, you might want to try examining and repairing of your model with third-party software. After doing that, you may try importing and converting of your model again.
