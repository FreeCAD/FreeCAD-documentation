# Installing more workbenches/en
## Introduction

Since v0.17 it is easy to add [external workbenches](external_workbenches.md) by using the [Addon Manager](Std_AddonMgr.md). A regular user doesn\'t need to do more than use this tool.

Keep reading for more information regarding installation of workbenches.

## General description 

Workbenches are nothing more than collections of files that are placed in a folder. This folder is usually compressed into a zip archive. On installation, this folder is simply uncompressed and copied to


```python
$ROOT_DIR/Mod/
```

where `$ROOT_DIR` is a top level directory searched by FreeCAD on startup. This is essentially what the [Addon Manager](Std_AddonMgr.md) does.

The `Mod/` directories are scanned every time FreeCAD is started, and the available workbenches are automatically added.

## Installing system-wide 

Workbenches installed in this way will be available to all users. Depending on your system, you might need administrator privileges to access the installation directory.

Copy the workbench folder into `$INSTALL_DIR/Mod/`, where `$INSTALL_DIR` is the FreeCAD installation directory.

-   On Linux it is usually `/usr/share/freecad/Mod/`
-   On Windows it is usually `C:\Program Files\FreeCAD\Mod\`
-   On macOS it is usually `/Applications/FreeCAD/Mod/`

## Installing for a single user 

Workbenches installed in this way will be available only to one user, but will not require any administrator privileges.

Copy the workbench folder into `$USER_DIR/Mod/`, where `$USER_DIR` is the FreeCAD directory for a particular `username` (you can find the latter by typing `App.getUserAppDataDir()` in the [Python console](Python_console.md)).

-   On Linux it is usually `/home/username/.local/share/FreeCAD/Mod/`
-   On Windows it is `%APPDATA%\FreeCAD\Mod\`, which is usually `C:\Users\username\Appdata\Roaming\FreeCAD\Mod\`
-   On macOS it is usually `/Users/username/Library/Application Support/FreeCAD/Mod/`.

## Additional information 

Additional information on how to create a custom workbench can be found in the [Power users hub](Power_users_hub.md) and the [Developer hub](Developer_hub.md).
