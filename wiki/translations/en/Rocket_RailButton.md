# Rocket RailButton/en

## Description

A rail button is a small button attached to the side of the rocket that allows the rocket to be guided using a rail until it is fast enough to be aerodynamically stable.

## Usage

1.  There are several ways to invoke the command:
    -   Press the **<img src="images/Rocket_RailGuide.svg" width=16px> [Rail Button](Rocket_RailButton.md)** button.
    -   Select the **Rocket → Launch Guides→ <img src="images/Rocket_RailButton.svg" width=16px> Rail Button** option from the menu.
    -   Double click on a Rail Button object in the [Tree view](Tree_view.md).
2.  Set options and press **OK**.

## Options

### Rail Button Shapes 

Rail buttons have two general shapes:

-   Round.

*Round Rail Button*

The round shape is the most common and is the simplest to manufacture in bulk. As the name implies, the button is round, with a groove that allows it to fit onto the launch rail. It may be glued to the main body, but is more typically fastened with a screw.

-   Airfoil.

*Airfoiled Rail Button*

The airfoil shape improved on the basic round button by giving it a more streamlined shape. Similar to the round button, it has a groove that allows it to fit on the launch rail. Adding a fillet on the top edges has been shown to further improve aerodynamic performance.
