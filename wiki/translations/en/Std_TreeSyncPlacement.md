# Std TreeSyncPlacement/en

## Description

The **Std TreeSyncPlacement** command toggles the [Tree view](Tree_view.md) SyncPlacement mode. If this mode is on, the **Placement** of objects is automatically adjusted when they are dragged and dropped from one container into another container with a different coordinate system, preserving their placement relative to the global coordinate system.

## Usage

1.  There are several ways to invoke the command:
    -   Click on the black down arrow to the right of the **<img src="images/Std_TreeSyncView.svg" width=16px>** button and select the **Sync placement** option from the flyout. Note: the button image will change depending on the selected option.
    -   Select the **View → TreeView actions → Sync placement** option from the menu.
    -   Use the keyboard shortcut: **T** then **3**.
