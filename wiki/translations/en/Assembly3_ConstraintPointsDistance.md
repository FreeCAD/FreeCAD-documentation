This tool builds a link between two objects of an assembly and fixes the distance between them and the orientation to each other. The selected elements of each object or more precisely their implicit coordinate systems (ICS) are used to position one object to another.

## Usage

2.  Select one point element of each object
3.  Press the **<img src="images/Assembly_ConstraintPointsDistance.svg" width=16px> [Points distance](Assembly3_ConstraintPointsDistance.md)** button.
