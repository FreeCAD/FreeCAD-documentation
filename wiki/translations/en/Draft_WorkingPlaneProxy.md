# Draft WorkingPlaneProxy/en

## Description

The <img alt="" src=images/Draft_WorkingPlaneProxy.svg  style="width:24px;"> **Draft WorkingPlaneProxy** command creates a working plane proxy to save the current [Draft working plane](Draft_SelectPlane.md). A working plane proxy can be used to quickly restore a working plane. The camera position and visibility of the objects in the [3D view](3D_view.md) are also saved in the working plane proxy and can, [optionally](#Properties.md), be restored as well.

## Usage

1.  Optionally change the [working plane](Draft_SelectPlane.md).
2.  Optionally change the [3D view](3D_view.md).
3.  Optionally change the visibility state of objects in the document.
4.  There are several ways to invoke the command:
    -   Press the **<img src="images/Draft_WorkingPlaneProxy.svg" width=16px> [Create working plane proxy](Draft_WorkingPlaneProxy.md)** button.
    -   Select the **Utilities → <img src="images/Draft_WorkingPlaneProxy.svg" width=16px> Create working plane proxy** option from the menu.
5.  A working plane proxy is created.
6.  To align the [working plane](Draft_SelectPlane.md) with a working plane proxy, double-click the working plane proxy in the [Tree view](Tree_view.md) or use it with the [Draft SelectPlane](Draft_SelectPlane.md) command.

## Context menu 

For a Draft WorkingPlaneProxy these additional options are available in the [Tree view](Tree_view.md) context menu:

-    **<img src="images/Draft_SelectPlane.svg" width=16px> Write camera position**: updates the **View Data** property of the working plane proxy with the current [3D view](3D_view.md) camera settings.

-    **<img src="images/Draft_SelectPlane.svg" width=16px> Write objects state**: updates the **Visibility Map** property of the working plane proxy with the current visibility state of objects in the document.

## Notes

-   Working plane proxies can be [moved](Draft_Move.md) and [rotated](Draft_Rotate.md) like any other object. Use <img alt="" src=images/Draft_Snap_Center.svg  style="width:16px;"> [Draft Snap Center](Draft_Snap_Center.md) to snap to their **Placement** point.

## Properties

See also: [Property editor](Property_editor.md).

A Draft WorkingPlaneProxy object is derived from an [App FeaturePython](App_FeaturePython.md) object and inherits all its properties. It also has the following additional properties:

### Data


{{TitleProperty|Base}}

-    **Placement|Placement**: specifies the position of the working plane proxy in the [3D view](3D_view.md). See [Placement](Placement.md).

-    **Shape|Shape|Hidden**: specifies the shape of the working plane proxy.

### View


{{TitleProperty|Base}}

-    **Line Color|Color**: specifies the color of all elements of the working plane proxy.

-    **Line Width|Float**: specifies the line width of the axes and arrow symbols.

-    **Restore State|Bool**: specifies if the **Visibility Map** is restored when the [working plane](Draft_SelectPlane.md) is aligned with the working plane proxy.

-    **Restore View|Bool**: specifies if the **View Data** is restored when the [working plane](Draft_SelectPlane.md) is aligned with the working plane proxy.

-    **Transparency|Percent**: specifies the transparency of the face of the working plane proxy.

-    **View Data|FloatList**: specifies the camera position and settings.

-    **Visibility Map|Map|Hidden**: specifies the visibility state of objects.


{{TitleProperty|Draft}}

-    **Arrow Size|Length**: specifies the size of the arrow symbols displayed at the tip of the three axes.

-    **Display Size|Length**: specifies the length and width of the working plane proxy.

## Scripting

See also: [Autogenerated API documentation](https://freecad.github.io/SourceDoc/) and [FreeCAD Scripting Basics](FreeCAD_Scripting_Basics.md).

To create a Draft WorkingPlaneProxy use the `make_workingplaneproxy` method of the Draft module.

If the [Draft Workbench](Draft_Workbench.md) is active the FreeCAD application object has a `DraftWorkingPlane` property which stores the current working plane. The {{Incode|Placement}} from the {{Incode|getPlacement}} method of the `DraftWorkingPlane` object can be used to create an aligned working plane proxy. The {{Incode|Placement}} of a working plane proxy in turn can be used to realign the working plane.


```python
# This code only works if the Draft Workbench is active!

import FreeCAD as App
import FreeCADGui as Gui
import Draft

doc = App.newDocument()

workplane = App.DraftWorkingPlane
place = workplane.getPlacement()

proxy = Draft.make_workingplaneproxy(place)
proxy.ViewObject.DisplaySize = 3000
proxy.ViewObject.ArrowSize = 200

axis2 = App.Vector(1, 1, 1)
point2 = App.Vector(3000, 0, 0)
place2 = App.Placement(point2, App.Rotation(axis2, 90))

proxy2 = Draft.make_workingplaneproxy(place2)
proxy2.ViewObject.DisplaySize = 3000
proxy2.ViewObject.ArrowSize = 200

workplane.setFromPlacement(proxy2.Placement, rebase=True)
Gui.Snapper.setGrid()

doc.recompute()
```
