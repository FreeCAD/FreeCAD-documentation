# Draft Facebinder/en

## Description

The <img alt="" src=images/Draft_Facebinder.svg  style="width:24px;"> **Draft Facebinder** command creates a surface object from selected faces. A Draft Facebinder is parametric, it will update if you modify its source object(s).

It can be used to create an extrusion from a collection of faces. This extrusion can for example represent a wall finish in architectural design.

*Facebinder created from the faces of walls*

## Usage

1.  Select one or more faces.
2.  There are several ways to invoke the command:
    -   Press the **<img src="images/Draft_Facebinder.svg" width=16px> [Draft Facebinder](Draft_Facebinder.md)** button.
    -   Select the **Drafting → <img src="images/Draft_Facebinder.svg" width=16px> Facebinder** option from the menu.
    -   Use the keyboard shortcut: **F** then **F**.

## Properties

See also: [Property editor](Property_editor.md).

A Draft Facebinder object is derived from a [Part Feature](Part_Feature.md) object and inherits all its properties. It also has the following additional properties:

### Data


{{TitleProperty|Draft}}

-    **Area|Area**: (read-only) specifies the total area of the linked faces of the facebinder.

-    **Extrusion|Distance**: specifies the extrusion thickness of the facebinder.

-    **Faces|LinkSubList**: specifies the linked faces of the facebinder.

-    **Offset|Distance**: specifies an offset distance to apply between the facebinder and the original faces, prior to extrusion.

-    **Remove Splitter|Bool**: Specifies whether to remove splitter lines that divide co-planar faces of the facebinder.

-    **Sew|Bool**: Specifies whether to perform a topological sewing operation on the facebinder.

### View


{{TitleProperty|Draft}}

-    **Pattern|Enumeration**: specifies the [Draft Pattern](Draft_Pattern.md) with which to fill the faces of the facebinder. This property only works if **Display Mode** is {{value|Flat Lines}}.

-    **Pattern Size|Float**: specifies the size of the [Draft Pattern](Draft_Pattern.md).

## Scripting

See also: [Autogenerated API documentation](https://freecad.github.io/SourceDoc/) and [FreeCAD Scripting Basics](FreeCAD_Scripting_Basics.md).

To create a Draft Facebinder use the `make_facebinder` method (<small>(v0.19)</small> ) of the Draft module. This method replaces the deprecated `makeFacebinder` method.


```python
facebinder = make_facebinder(selectionset)
```

-   Creates a `facebinder` object from the given `selectionset`, which is a list of `SelectionObject`s as returned by `FreeCADGui.Selection.getSelectionEx()`. Only selected faces are taken into account.
    -   
        `selectionset`
        
        can also be a `PropertyLinkSubList`.

A `PropertyLinkSubList` is a list of tuples; each tuple contains as first element an `object`, and as second element a list (or tuple) of strings; these strings indicate the names of the sub-elements (faces) of that object.


```python
PropertyLinkSubList = [tuple1, tuple2, tuple3, ...]
PropertyLinkSubList = [(object1, list1), (object2, list2), (object3, list3), ...]
PropertyLinkSubList = [(object1, ['Face1', 'Face4', 'Face6']), ...]
PropertyLinkSubList = [(object1, ('Face1', 'Face4', 'Face6')), ...]
```

The thickness of the Facebinder can be added by overwriting its `Extrusion` attribute; the value is entered in millimeters.

The placement of the Facebinder can be changed by overwriting its `Placement` attribute, or by individually overwriting its `Placement.Base` and `Placement.Rotation` attributes.

Example:


```python
import FreeCAD as App
import FreeCADGui as Gui
import Draft

doc = App.newDocument()

# Insert a solid box
box = doc.addObject("Part::Box", "Box")
box.Length = 2300
box.Width = 800
box.Height = 1000

# selection = Gui.Selection.getSelectionEx()
selection = [(box, ("Face1", "Face6"))]
facebinder = Draft.make_facebinder(selection)
facebinder.Extrusion = 50

doc.recompute()

facebinder.Placement.Base = App.Vector(1000, -1000, 100)
facebinder.ViewObject.ShapeColor = (0.99, 0.99, 0.4)

doc.recompute()
```
