# Part Ellipsoid/en

## Description

A <img alt="" src=images/Part_Ellipsoid.svg  style="width:24px;"> **Part Ellipsoid** is a parametric solid that can be created with the <img alt="" src=images/Part_Primitives.svg  style="width:24px;"> [Part Primitives](Part_Primitives.md) command. In the coordinate system defined by its **Placement** property, the axes of the ellipsoid are aligned with the X, Y and Z axes, and therefore its center is positioned at the origin.

A Part Ellipsoid can be truncated at the top and/or bottom by changing its **Angle1** and/or **Angle2** properties. It can be turned into a segment of an ellipsoid by changing its **Angle3** property.

## Usage

See [Part Primitives](Part_Primitives#Usage.md).

## Example

![Part Ellipsoid from the scripting example](images/Part_Ellipsoid_Scripting_Example.png )

A Part Ellipsoid object created with the [scripting example](#Scripting.md) below is shown here.

## Properties

See also: [Property editor](Property_editor.md).

A Part Ellipsoid object is derived from a [Part Feature](Part_Feature.md) object and inherits all its properties. It also has the following additional properties:

### Data


{{TitleProperty|Attachment}}

The object has the same attachment properties as a [Part Part2DObject](Part_Part2DObject#Data.md).


{{TitleProperty|Ellipsoid}}

-    **Radius1|Length**: The radius of the ellipsoid in its Z direction. The default is {{Value|2mm}}.

-    **Radius2|Length**: The radius of the ellipsoid in its X direction. The default is {{Value|4mm}}.

-    **Radius3|Length**: The radius of the ellipsoid in its Y direction. The default is {{Value|4mm}}.

-    **Angle1|Angle**: The start angle of the elliptical sides of the ellipsoid. Valid range: {{Value|-90° &lt;&#61; value &lt; 90°}}. Must be smaller than **Angle2**. The default is {{Value|-90°}}.

-    **Angle2|Angle**: The end angle of the elliptical sides of the ellipsoid. Valid range: {{Value|-90° &lt; value &lt;&#61; 90°}}. Must be larger than **Angle1**. The default is {{Value|90°}}. If the total angle of the elliptical sides is smaller than {{Value|180°}} the ellipsoid will be truncated and have a flat face at the top and/or bottom.

-    **Angle3|Angle**: The total angle of the ellipsoid in its XY plane. Valid range: {{Value|0° &lt; value &lt;&#61; 360°}}. The default is {{Value|360°}}. If it is smaller than {{Value|360°}} the resulting solid will be a segment of an ellipsoid.

## Scripting

See also: [Autogenerated API documentation](https://freecad.github.io/SourceDoc/), [Part scripting](Part_scripting.md) and [FreeCAD Scripting Basics](FreeCAD_Scripting_Basics.md).

A Part Ellipsoid can be created with the {{Incode|addObject()}} method of the document:


```python
ellipsoid = FreeCAD.ActiveDocument.addObject("Part::Ellipsoid", "myEllipsoid")
```

-   Where {{Incode|"myEllipsoid"}} is the name for the object.
-   The function returns the newly created object.

Example:


```python
import FreeCAD as App

doc = App.activeDocument()

ellipsoid = doc.addObject("Part::Ellipsoid", "myEllipsoid")
ellipsoid.Radius1 = 2
ellipsoid.Radius2 = 4
ellipsoid.Radius3 = 6
ellipsoid.Angle1 = -90
ellipsoid.Angle2 = 50
ellipsoid.Angle3 = 300
ellipsoid.Placement = App.Placement(App.Vector(1, 2, 3), App.Rotation(15, 0, 20))

doc.recompute()
```
