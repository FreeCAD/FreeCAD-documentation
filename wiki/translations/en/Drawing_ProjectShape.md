## Usage

+++
| ![](images/ProjectShapeSet_it.png ) | 1.  Select an object in the 3D view or in the project tree                                                                                                                                                                       |
|                                                      | 2.  from the Drawing menu, click **Project shape**                                                                                                                                                                               |

|                                                      | A projection object (**objectname_proj**) will be added to the project. For subsequent projections of the same Source object, the projection object will be named **objectname_projXXX**, where **XXX** is a three digit number. |
