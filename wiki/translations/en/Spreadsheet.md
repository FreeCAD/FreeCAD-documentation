## Description

A [spreadsheet](spreadsheet.md) is a page that contains rows and columns that allows you to store arbitrary text in cells. More importantly, it allows you to use the cells with [expressions](Expressions.md) to calculate values that depend on previously entered values; these can be lengths, angles, areas, volumes, and other types.

## Usage

2.  Press **[<img src=images/Spreadsheet_CreateSheet.svg style="width:16px"> [Spreadsheet CreateSheet](Spreadsheet_CreateSheet.md)** to create a new sheet.
3.  Edit the contents of the cells.
4.  Close the spreadsheet tab when you are finished, the values are saved automatically as you type them.
