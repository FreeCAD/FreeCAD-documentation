# Assembly3 ConstraintLineHorizontal/en

## Description

This tool builds a link between two objects of an assembly. The selected elements of each object or more precisely their implicit coordinate systems (ICS) are used to position one object to another.

Based on one planar element\'s ICS the line element\'s start and end point are positioned to have identical y-coordinates.

## Usage

1.  Place two objects into an assembly
2.  Select a line elements of one object
3.  Select a planar face element of the second object
4.  Press the **<img src="images/Assembly_ConstraintLineHorizontal.svg" width=16px> [Line horizontal](Assembly3_ConstraintLineHorizontal.md)** button.
