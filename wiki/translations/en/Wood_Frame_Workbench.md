## Introduction

A complementary workbench for FreeCAD whose main goal is to provide tools to facilitate the modelling of wooden constructions (frame, timber frame, etc \...). This is a fork from [FreeCAD-Timber](https://github.com/wood-galaxy/FreeCAD-Timber) (Jonathan Wiedemann wood-galaxy), which is no longer maintained.

## Functions

-   Create beams with advanced positioning.
-   Create panels with advanced positioning.
-   Attributes, used to select and filter objects (name, groups, sub-group, material, type \....) easily.
-   Select and show by attributes.
-   Listing for invoices and production list.

## Tools

Wood Frame comes with the following tools:

-   Add a layer to the document: objects added to a layer can share the same visual properties.
-   Add a wood beam. To move insertion point, use the Numpad.
-   Add a wood panel. This tool operates similarly to Add beam, but with panel size restriction. To move insertion point, use the Numpad.
-   Cut an object with a plane.
-   Cut an object with a line with a normal work plane.
-   Copy object: duplicates an element.
-   Stretch tool: select an end of a beam and add or remove to its length.
-   Edit the attributes of existing objects (name, groups, sub-group, material, type\...).
-   Select or hide elements in the 3D view by their specific attributes.
-   Create wood beams listing: Generate a Spreadsheet listing of the different materials selected in the [3D view](3D_view.md).
-   Edit attributes.
-   Select by attributes.
-   Align camera-view on the current Work plane: Align view from current work plane.
-   Create exporter container: Create volume which contains objects to export, and configure views.
-   Add view to a container for export.
-   Export views to DXF: Export container views in a DXF file.
