# Drawing Annotation/en

## Description

This command allows you to place a block of text on a [Drawing page](Drawing_Landscape_A3.md).

## Usage

1.  Create a [Drawing page](Drawing_Landscape_A3.md)
2.  [Refresh](Std_Refresh.md) the view if a Drawing view wasn\'t opened
3.  Press the **<img src="images/Drawing_Annotation.png" width=16px> [Drawing Annotation](Drawing_Annotation.md)** button
4.  Adjust the desired properties, such as text contents, font, size and position.

## Limitations

-   Texts spanned on multiple lines are not supported by the internal Qt-based Svg viewer, but the [Open Browser](Drawing_Openbrowser.md) command shows these texts correctly.
