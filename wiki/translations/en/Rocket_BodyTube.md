## Description

Body tubes are the basic building block of all rockets. It typically contain the motor and payload, and server as an attachment point for the fins and nose cone.

The body tube tool can be used to create many components other than body tubes, for example: motor mounts, engine blocks, and launch lugs. Centering rings can be thought of as short body tubes with very thick walls, although the workbench has a tool specifically for them.
