## Description

The **Std SelForward** command restores the next recorded [Tree view](Tree_view.md) selection. Note that selections are only recorded if [Tree RecordSelection mode](Std_TreeRecordSelection.md) is switched on.

## Usage

1.  There has to be a next Tree view selection.
2.  Press the **<img src="images/Std_SelForward.svg" width=16px> [Forward](Std_SelForward.md)** button.
3.  The next selection is restored.

## Notes

-   Only [Tree view](Tree_view.md) selections are recorded. To record a selection made in the [3D view](3D_view.md) a final object has to be added in the Tree view.
