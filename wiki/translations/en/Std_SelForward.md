# Std SelForward/en

## Description

The **Std SelForward** command restores the next recorded [Tree view](Tree_view.md) selection. Note that selections are only recorded if [Tree RecordSelection mode](Std_TreeRecordSelection.md) is switched on.

## Usage

1.  There has to be a next Tree view selection.
2.  There are several ways to invoke the command:
    -   Click on the black down arrow to the right of the **<img src="images/Std_TreeSyncView.svg" width=16px>** button and select the **<img src="images/Std_SelForward.svg" width=16px> Selection forward** option from the flyout. Note: the button image will change depending on the selected option.
    -   Select the **View → TreeView actions → <img src="images/Std_SelForward.svg" width=16px> Selection forward** option from the menu.
    -   Use the keyboard shortcut: **S** then **F**.
3.  The next selection is restored.

## Notes

-   Only [Tree view](Tree_view.md) selections are recorded. To record a selection made in the [3D view](3D_view.md) a final object has to be added in the Tree view.
