## Introduction

In FreeCAD the word \"[Model](Model.md)\" is normally used to refer to any 3D object, or collection of objects, created in the [3D view](3D_view.md).

That is, a \"Model\" can be anything created by the tools of FreeCAD, for example, the [PartDesign Workbench](PartDesign_Workbench.md) or any of the other [workbenches](Workbenches.md).

## Notes

In informal usage, the word \"[Drawing](Drawing.md)\" may be used with the same meaning as \"Model\". However, when more precision is required, the distinction must be made.

-   A \"Model\" is any 3D or 2D object created in the [3D view](3D_view.md), for example, a PartDesign [Body](Body.md), or [Part](Part.md) containing many such Bodies.
-   A \"Drawing\" is a strictly 2D projection of that \"Model\", usually created with the [TechDraw Workbench](TechDraw_Workbench.md) tools. This \"Drawing\" is usually intended for printing or for export.
-   The \"Model\" is usually the real object intended for manufacturing, while the \"Drawing\" is an auxiliary, flat representation of that \"Model\" which will be used for reference and documentation purposes.
