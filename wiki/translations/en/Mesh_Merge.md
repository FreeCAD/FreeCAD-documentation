# Mesh Merge/en

## Description

The **Mesh Merge** command creates a new non-parametric mesh object, a [Mesh Feature](Mesh_Feature.md), by combining the meshes of two or more mesh objects. The command does not perform a Boolean union, the new object will contain separate mesh components. For a Boolean union use the [Mesh Union](Mesh_Union.md) command instead. This command is the counterpart of the [Mesh SplitComponents](Mesh_SplitComponents.md) command.

## Usage

1.  Select two or more mesh objects.
2.  There are several ways to invoke the command:
    -   Press the **<img src="images/Mesh_Merge.svg" width=16px> [Mesh Merge](Mesh_Merge.md)** button.
    -   Select the **Meshes → <img src="images/Mesh_Merge.svg" width=16px> Merge** option from the menu.

## Properties

See: [Mesh Feature](Mesh_Feature.md).
