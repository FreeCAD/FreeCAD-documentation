# FEM ConstraintSelfWeight/en

## Description

Constraint self weight defines gravity acceleration 9,81 m/s\^2 acting on the whole model in the prescribed direction.

## Usage

1.  There are several ways to invoke the command:
    -   Press the **<img src="images/FEM_ConstraintSelfWeight.svg" width=16px> [FEM ConstraintSelfWeight](FEM_ConstraintSelfWeight.md)** button.
    -   Select the **Model → Mechanical Constraints → <img src="images/FEM_ConstraintSelfWeight.svg" width=16px> Constraint self weight** option from the menu.
2.  You can modify the direction of gravitation by changing its vector coordinates in the property bar of newly created ConstraintSelfWeight object.

## Scripting

New object:


```python
import ObjectsFem
ObjectsFem.makeConstraintSelfWeight(name)
```

Add object to the analysis named Analysis:


```python
App.ActiveDocument.Analysis.Member = App.ActiveDocument.Analysis.Member + [(object)]
```

Example:


```python
import ObjectsFem
selfweight_obj = ObjectsFem.makeConstraintSelfWeight("MySelfWeightObject")
App.ActiveDocument.Analysis.Member = App.ActiveDocument.Analysis.Member + [selfweight_obj]
```

## Solver CalculiX 

### Limitations

-   You need to modify .inp file to edit gravity acceleration.
-   Self weight is applied to the element set Eall means to the whole model.

### Editing CalculiX input file 

Acceleration constant can be edited by hand modification after generating CalculiX input file.

Example of lines in .inp file:


```python
*DLOAD
Eall,GRAV,9810,0.0,0.0,-1.0
```

where 9810 is gravity acceleration magnitude in \[mm/s\^2\], and 0,0,-1 is direction vector.

## Solver Z88 

-   not implemented in Z88 solver (March 2017)
