## Continuous Integration 

Currently the FreeCAD repository on GitHub will trigger a build on several CI systems. Between these systems pretty much all the main OSs are coveredː Linux, macOS, and Windows. CIs can also be used to run [unit tests](Testing.md).

## Tips

-   If you add {{Incode|[skip ci]}} or {{Incode|[ci skip]}} to a git commit it will cancel a CI build.

## Relevant links
