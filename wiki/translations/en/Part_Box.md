# Part Box/en

## Description

The <img alt="" src=images/Part_Box.svg  style="width:24px;"> **Part Box** command creates a parametric box solid, a [rectangular cuboid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuboid#Rectangular_cuboid). In the coordinate system defined by its **Placement** property, the bottom face of the box lies on the XY plane with its front left corner at the origin, and its front edge parallel to the X axis.

## Usage

1.  There are several ways to invoke the command:
    -   Press the **<img src="images/Part_Box.svg" width=16px> [Part Box](Part_Box.md)** button.
    -   Select the **Part → Primitives → <img src="images/Part_Box.svg" width=16px> Cube** option from the menu.
2.  The box is created.
3.  Optionally change the dimensions and **Placement** of the box by doing one of the following:
    -   Double-click the object in the [Tree view](Tree_view.md):
        1.  The **Geometric Primitives** task panel opens.
        2.  Change one or more properties.
        3.  The object is dynamically updated in the [3D view](3D_view.md).
        4.  Press the **OK** button.
    -   Change the properties in the [Property editor](Property_editor.md).
    -   Change the **Placement** with the <img alt="" src=images/Std_TransformManip.svg  style="width:16px;"> [Std TransformManip](Std_TransformManip.md) command.

## Example

![Part Box from the scripting example](images/Part_Box_Scripting_Example.png )

A Part Box object created with the [scripting example](#Scripting.md) below is shown here.

## Notes

-   A Part Box can also be created with the <img alt="" src=images/Part_Primitives.svg  style="width:16px;"> [Part Primitives](Part_Primitives.md) command. With that command you can specify the dimensions and placement at creation time.

## Properties

See also: [Property editor](Property_editor.md).

A Part Box object is derived from a [Part Feature](Part_Feature.md) object and inherits all its properties. It also has the following additional properties:

### Data


{{TitleProperty|Attachment}}

The object has the same attachment properties as a [Part Part2DObject](Part_Part2DObject#Data.md).


{{TitleProperty|Box}}

-    **Length|Length**: The length of the box. This is the dimension in its X direction. The default is {{Value|10mm}}.

-    **Width|Length**: The width of the box. This is the dimension in its Y direction. The default is {{Value|10mm}}.

-    **Height|Length**: The height of the box. This is dimension in its Z direction. The default is {{Value|10mm}}.

## Scripting

See also: [Autogenerated API documentation](https://freecad.github.io/SourceDoc/), [Part scripting](Part_scripting.md) and [FreeCAD Scripting Basics](FreeCAD_Scripting_Basics.md).

A Part Box can be created with the {{Incode|addObject()}} method of the document:


```python
box = FreeCAD.ActiveDocument.addObject("Part::Box", "myBox")
```

-   Where {{Incode|"myBox"}} is the name for the object.
-   The function returns the newly created object.

Example:


```python
import FreeCAD as App

doc = App.activeDocument()

box = doc.addObject("Part::Box", "myBox")
box.Length = 4
box.Width = 8
box.Height = 12
box.Placement = App.Placement(App.Vector(1, 2, 3), App.Rotation(75, 60, 30))

doc.recompute()
```
