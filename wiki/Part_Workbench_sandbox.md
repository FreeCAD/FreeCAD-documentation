## Introduction

The <img alt="" src=images/Workbench_Part.svg  style="width:32px;"> **Part Workbench** provides a traditional [constructive solid geometry](Constructive_solid_geometry.md) (CSG) workflow. In this workflow each object is an independent solid. The Part Workbench can create them from parametrically defined sketches (See: <img alt="" src=images/Workbench_Sketcher.svg  style="width:24px;"> [Sketcher](Sketcher_Workbench.md)) using tools like Extrude, Revolve, Loft, etc. In addition, basic primitives like Cube, Cylinder, etc. can be created as well. These objects can be combined, with Boolean operations, to create more complex solids.

The Part Workbench can also create objects that are not solids, such as faces, shells and objects with only edges or vertices. It also provides a variety of other general purpose tools for geometry manipulation, geometry validation, and making copies.

[PartDesign Workbench](PartDesign_Workbench.md) provides an alternative workflow for creating solids.

A more detailed discussion of the Part Workbench versus Part Design Workbench can be found here: [Part and Part Design](Part_and_PartDesign.md).
