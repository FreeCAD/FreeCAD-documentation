# Sandbox:Wishlist
## Introduction

This page is a wishlist of items that can improve the FreeCAD experience.

Anyone is free to add / remove / modify items here, i.e. help in recording new ideas and keeping it decently up to date. The purpose of the wishlist is not to replace forum posts, bug reports or feature requests, but rather serve as an incomplete overview of identified improvement areas.

The page is a complement to the [Workarounds](Workarounds.md) page, and less well maintained [Roadmap Category](:Category_Roadmap.md) on this Wiki.

The page has 4 benefits:

-   people can scan the page to see if an idea of theirs is already noted down
-   minimal effort to capture an idea that is then possible to find back
-   works for people that are not present at gh
-   avoids ideas to fade to a less discoverable spot in the forum

  0.20       Selection methods                Modify     There are multiple paradigms for how to select objects/entities for use with a command.             More streamlined through the application. In order for that to happen, someone needs to make a detailed overview of how it works today for all corners of FreeCAD. That overview, to date, does not exist. So do not expect anything to happen on this topic unless it is kicked off with creating an overview.

  0.20       Control of spin widget ticks     New        Different spin widgets have different tick-steps, some in preference, some hardcoded?               Add functionality to alter tick-size on the fly. Think font size up/down but for decimal point location. Should be part of std toolbar and affect relevant widgets.

Librecad does it this way, and it is very convenient.

Simplest is probably just an additional preset filter with category. Both macros and wb's have a categorization already available, that should be possible to use in the addonmgr.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
  0.20       Internal rounding                          New            One symptom is for example that placement all of a sudden is -0.00                                                                                                                                                        That there was a possibility to apply round to geometries in an easy way. Should work application wide, i.e. any new geometry is created with rounded values (no more 1.23456e-7 instead of 0) with user setting. Think this implies a sort of inspection round when geometry comes back from occ. Should also be possible to take for example a polyline and round those coordinates to a given decimal number, analogue for a shell/solid/mesh and its vertexes.

  0.20       Pip install through gui                    New            Pip install is currently only by shell.                                                                                                                                                                                   Create a gui for correct installation of additional libs. Could be pip, conda, apt, etc based on existing install. If not actually running the command, at least it could produce a string to copy into shell, with info from which directory to run it from. Should be possible to do even for appimages.

  0.20       Arrow for direction                        New            There is no visual indication of where a placement/attachment edit goes.                                                                                                                                                  Show an arrow indicating positive direction when user enters edit mode of such property, i.e when clicking for example z, an arrow will appear showing the positive direction an altered value will move the entity. Does not do much when everything is aligned to global xyz, but helps when coord sys are nested and individually rotated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
  0.20       Creation / edit coordinates                New            When creating / editing draft objects the coordinate inputs are always tracking 3d-view mouse movements. This is unpractical if one just wants to enter coordinates, and happen to move the mouse in the 3d view.         a\) a reset button, so that all goes to zero b) checkbox for switching off tracking of 3d-view coordinates in input widgets.

  0.20       Dxf import                                 New            Dxf import is a constant and reoccurring source of forum posts showcasing different issues.                                                                                                                               Use ezdxf as base for dxf import, seems like parts of ezdxf can optionally be compiled for speed. In any case a pure python importer based on ezdxf appears to have ability to outpace current c-importer, so a pure python implementation to begin with focusing on coverage should be good enough.

  0.20       Move                            Modify     If wanting to make for example 10 lines as transformed copies, when using draft/move and enabling "continue & copy" the dialogue still automatically closes when 2nd point is defined.                                                                                                                                                                 Keep dialogue open for a new move. Additionally when in copy/continue mode, the 1st point can be skipped, it should be the 2nd point of the last move (with relative setting that is zero, but it would save one button press if there was no need to re-enter that)

A chain select command in base wb's (std/draft/part?) with option to a) chain connected b) chain tangent. Should also not break out of command when hitting a branch of edges, it should simply stay in selection mode and allow for selection of branch and thus continue the chain.

First fontsize should be a portion of document bounding box. Rather than the application default, there should be a document default value, and once that is set, it stays -- so no change in property as such, just how the first value is set in a document.

There are more than split, for example shapestring.                                                                                                                                                    [Draft Split](Draft_Split.md) does not have a task panel and the [Draft ShapeString](Draft_ShapeString.md) task panel closes with Esc. AFAICT the only task panel that does not close with Esc belongs to the [Draft Hatch](Draft_Hatch.md) command.   
  0.20       Split / downgrade etc           Modify     When using a dividing function in draft, split, downgrade, etc. If the object is in a group the new objects end up in root.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Dividing operations should respect the original object location (group/layer) and be created in that location.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
  0.20       Points removal from wires       New        Currently 3 clicks (and 2 hands) are required to remove a point from a wire. Alt needs to be pressed, the point needs to clicked, rmb needs to be clicked and "delete point" needs to be clicked in the context menu.                                                                                                                                  Allow for box selection in the wire edit mode and have a button for deletion of points, or possibly context menu entry.

  0.20       ShapeString                     Modify     ShapeString does not allow for alternative aligning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Make aligning properties such as "right-align", "center", etc. the full capability would be NSEW or any combination of those with the additional centre option.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
  0.20       Draft linestyle                 Modify     To reproduce: change linestyles to "dashed", the gap is dynamic based on object size and zoom (assuming this, but that is how it appears to work on screen). Now if one object is about half in size, it will appear as solid line on screen although dashed is set, this is valid when zoomed out, if one zooms in it appears dashed on the screen.   Modify gap algo to care for all objects in such way that dashed is dashed on the screen (btw, dashdot behaves different...)

  0.20       Optional "missing coincidences check"   New        Not being able to extrude/pad due to missing coincidences in sketches is a constant and reoccurring source of forum posts.   Auto check for missing coincidences when closing a sketch. Should be a preference to switch behaviour on/off. Should be on as default since the target audience is new users. That there are usecases for open vertexes should not affect this, deliberate open vertexes have little to do with missing coincidences. Could be made fancy and only raise the info dialogue if found and be silent if nothing is found.   [forum thread](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=66091)

  0.20       Hole                   Modify         Direction of hole is always same, occasionally leading to a hole initially not being made, this confuses users   Add heuristics to apply a direction of the hole that is actually producing a cavity. Heuristics is only for best guess during creation. The "reverse" property should stay as a static property.

Repair option to merge close points, with dialogue to set distance (in mm) for what qualifies as a close point. Returns a new mesh with valid topology.

Allow for selection of faces, and a graphical way to hide them along with a reset button. The hiding should be persistent, so that one can use other operations while hidden.

  0.20       Mesh boolean icons   Modify     Think they are not disabled although fc cannot find a valid OpenSCad installation.

  0.20       Scaling              Modify     Gui only allows for uniform scale.
