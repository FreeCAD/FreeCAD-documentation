# Sketcher MirrorSketch

## Description

Mirror a sketch along the x-axis, the y-axis, or the origin. This command is invoked while *not* editing a sketch. It creates a new sketch which contains the mirrored geometry.

## Usage

1.  Select sketch to be mirrored (typically by clicking on it in the [tree view](Tree_view.md)).
2.  Click on **<img src=images/Sketcher_MirrorSketch.svg style="width:16px"> <img src=images/Sketcher_MirrorSketch.svg style="width:Mirror sketch](Sketcher_MirrorSketch.md)** or choose **Sketch → [16px"> [Mirror sketch](Sketcher_MirrorSketch.md)** from the top menu.
3.  The resulting sketch is created as a separate new object.

Notes:

-   Multiple sketches can be selected before applying the operation.
