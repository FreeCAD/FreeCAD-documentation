# Arch Rebar Slab Reinforcement

## Description

The [Slab Reinforcement](Arch_Rebar_Slab_Reinforcement.md) tool allows the user to create reinforcing bars inside a Slab [Arch Structure](Arch_Structure.md) object.

This command is part of the [Reinforcement Workbench](Reinforcement_Workbench.md), an [external workbench](External_workbenches.md) that can be installed with the <img alt="" src=images/Std_AddonMgr.svg  style="width:24px;"> [Addon Manager](Std_AddonMgr.md) via the **Tools → Addon manager → Reinforcement** menu.
