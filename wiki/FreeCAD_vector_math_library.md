# FreeCAD vector math library
## Introduction

This is a [Python](Python.md) module containing a couple of useful functions to manipulate vectors. This library is included in the [Draft_Workbench](Draft_Workbench.md) and can be accessed like this from the Python interpreter:  
```python
import DraftVecUtils
```

Please note that this module was created a long time ago, when the `Vector` class didn\'t have many of its methods. Now these operations can be done by the Vector class itself.

Although the `DraftVecUtils` module still exists, and it is still used inside the [Draft Workbench](Draft_Workbench.md), it is probably better to use the `Vector` methods directly for new developments.

## Functions

Vectors are the building bricks of almost all 3D geometric operations, so it is useful to know a bit about them to understand how these functions can be useful to you. A couple of good pages to learn the basics of vector math:
