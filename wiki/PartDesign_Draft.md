# PartDesign Draft

## Description

The <img alt="" src=images/PartDesign_Draft.svg  style="width:24px;"> **PartDesign Draft** tool creates angular draft on the selected faces of an object. It adds a **Draft** object to the document with its corresponding representation in the [Tree view](Tree_view.md).

## Usage

### Add a draft 

1.  Optionally [activate](PartDesign_Body#Active_status.md) the Body to apply the Draft to.
2.  Select one or more faces of the Body.
3.  There are several ways to invoke the tool:
    -   Press the **<img src="images/PartDesign_Draft.svg" width=16px> [Draft](PartDesign_Draft.md)** button.
    -   Select the **Part Design → Apply a dress-up feature → <img src="images/PartDesign_Draft.svg" width=16px> Draft** option from the menu.
4.  If there is no active Body, and there are two or more Bodies in the document, the **Active Body Required** dialog will open and prompt you to activate one. If there is a single Body it will be activated automatically.
5.  The **Draft parameters** [task panel](Task_panel.md) opens. See [Options](#Options.md) for more information.
6.  Press the **OK** button to finish.

:   *Remember*:
    -   Since there must be at least one face for the feature, the last remaining face in the list cannot be removed.

### Edit a draft 

1.  Do one of the following:
    -   Double-click the Draft object in the [Tree view](Tree_view.md).
    -   Right-click the Draft object in the [Tree view](Tree_view.md) and select **Edit Draft** from the context menu.
2.  The **Draft parameters** [task panel](Task_panel.md) opens. See [Options](#Options.md) for more information.
3.  Press the **OK** button to finish.

## Options

-    **Add face**: Add faces to the selection by pressing the **Add face** button and selecting more faces.

-    **Remove face**: Choose a way to remove faces from the selection:

    -   Select one or more faces in the list and press the **Del** key or right-click the list and select **Remove** from the context menu.
    -   Press the **Remove face** button. All previously selected faces are highlighted in purple. Select each face to be removed.

-    **Draft angle**: Set the Draft angle either by entering a value or by clicking the up/down arrows.

-    **Neutral plane**: Set the the neutral plane by pressing the **Neutral plane** button and selecting the plane that must not change dimensionally.

-    **Pull direction**: Set the the pull direction by pressing the **Pull direction** button, then select an edge. Pull Direction is only effective if the Neutral Plane has been set. Results can be unpredictable.

-    **Reverse pull direction**: Invert the pull direction by checking the **Reverse pull direction** checkbox. This will toggle the draft between positive and negative angles.

## Notes

-   The Draft tool will only work on faces that are not tangentially connected to other faces. A common mistake is to attempt to apply draft to a face that already has a fillet applied to it. To solve this, remove the fillet, apply the draft as needed, then re-apply the fillet.

## Properties

See also: [Property editor](Property_editor.md).

A PartDesign Draft object is derived from a [Part Feature](Part_Feature.md) object and inherits all its properties. It also has the following additional properties:

### Data

-    **Reversed|Bool**: Default: `False`.

-    **Base|LinkSub**: Sub-link to the parent feature\'s list of selected edges and faces.

-    **Support Transform|Bool**: \"Include the base additive/subtractive shape when used in pattern features. If disabled, only the dressed part of the shape is used for patterning\". Default: `False`.

-    **Add Sub Shape|PartShape|hidden**
    

-    **Base Feature|Link|hidden**: Link to the parent feature.

-    **_ Body|LinkHidden|hidden**: Link to the parent body.


{{Properties_Title|Draft}}

-    **Neutral Plane|LinkSub**: Sub-link to the parent feature\'s list containing the neutral plane.

-    **Pull Direction|LinkSub**
    


{{Properties_Title|Part Design}}
