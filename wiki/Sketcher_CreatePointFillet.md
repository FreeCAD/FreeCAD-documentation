# Sketcher CreatePointFillet

## Description

This tool creates a fillet between two lines. The (virtual) intersection of the lines is preserved by adding a [point](Sketcher_CreatePoint.md) that has a [point onto object constraint](Sketcher_ConstrainPointOnObject.md) with both lines. Apart from that this tool is identical to the [Sketcher CreateFillet](Sketcher_CreateFillet.md) tool. See there for more information.
