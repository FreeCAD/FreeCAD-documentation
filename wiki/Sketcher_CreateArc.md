# Sketcher CreateArc

## Description

This tool draws an arc by picking three points: the center, the start angle along the radius, and the end angle.

When starting the tool, the mouse pointer changes to a white cross with a red arc icon. The coordinates of the pointer are shown beside it in blue in real time.

## Usage

-   Pick points on an empty area of the 3D view, or on an existing object (auto constraints must be active in the [Task panel](Task_panel.md)).
-   Pressing **Esc** or clicking the right mouse button cancels the function.
