# Part Plane

## Description

A <img alt="" src=images/Part_Plane.svg  style="width:24px;"> **Part Plane** is a parametric rectangular plane that can be created with the <img alt="" src=images/Part_Primitives.svg  style="width:24px;"> [Part Primitives](Part_Primitives.md) command. In the coordinate system defined by its **Placement** property, the plane lies on the XY plane with its front left corner at the origin, and its front edge parallel to the X axis.

## Usage

See [Part Primitives](Part_Primitives#Usage.md).

## Example

![Part Plane from the scripting example](images/Part_Plane_Scripting_Example.png )

A Part Plane object created with the [scripting example](#Scripting.md) below is shown here.

## Properties

See also: [Property editor](Property_editor.md).

A Part Plane object is derived from a [Part Feature](Part_Feature.md) object and inherits all its properties. It also has the following additional properties:

### Data


{{TitleProperty|Attachment}}

The object has the same attachment properties as a [Part Part2DObject](Part_Part2DObject#Data.md).


{{TitleProperty|Plane}}

-    **Length|Length**: The length of the plane. This is the dimension in its X direction. The default is {{Value|10mm}}.

-    **Width|Length**: The width of the plane. This is the dimension in its Y direction. The default is {{Value|10mm}}.

## Scripting

See also: [Autogenerated API documentation](https://freecad.github.io/SourceDoc/), [Part scripting](Part_scripting.md) and [FreeCAD Scripting Basics](FreeCAD_Scripting_Basics.md).

A Part Plane can be created with the {{Incode|addObject()}} method of the document:

 
```python
plane = FreeCAD.ActiveDocument.addObject("Part::Plane", "myPlane")
```

-   Where {{Incode|"myPlane"}} is the name for the object.
-   The function returns the newly created object.

Example:

 
```python
import FreeCAD as App

doc = App.activeDocument()

plane = doc.addObject("Part::Plane", "myPlane")
plane.Length = 4
plane.Width = 8
plane.Placement = App.Placement(App.Vector(1, 2, 3), App.Rotation(20, 75, 60))

doc.recompute()
```
